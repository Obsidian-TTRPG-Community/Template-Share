- The Eidola and Nadir are a group of beings called Outer Sovrans. Outer Sovrans are beings that have both magic and technology of immense power that allows them to create, destroy, and alter reality.
- The Eidola and Nadir have been locked in a war since they have met a long long long time ago.
- The Eidola created a galaxy called Ori in which it kept hidden from the Nadir for a long time. Enough for the Eidola to create beings called Empyreans who could then start building the galaxy of Ori.
- Orion was the first and the Architect of Ori and created the planets, Tyrana, Aladon, Nerma and Anwyn. The realm of Astera would be created by one of his sisters named Eido Empyra of the Stars, and Illiya by one of his brothers named Eos Emprya of the Dawn.
- Aladon served as originally a planet for Dragons to grow and prosper. Nerma was a place in which creatures of mythic could thrive without being a threat for mortals, and Anwyn was the planet in which spirits and fantastical creatures would roam.
- Eventually the Nadir and other Outer Sovrans learned of Ori. Two Sovrans named [[Azmora]] and [[Odeon]]
- Sardis who was once originally [[Bellar]] Empyra of Justice and Balance was tempted by Typhon to leave the power of the Eidola and became ruler of Azera by making a pact with the [[Outer Sovran]] [[Azmora]]
