## [[Ruins and Dungeon Generator]]
# INITIAL PRIMER
I am a dungeon master playing `=this.gamesystem`.  I need to design a dungeon.

I consider a dungeon to have the following information:
Name:  An `=this.themename` name
Age of Dungeon: `=this.dunage`
Description:  A description of the location
Theme:  `=this.themetype` featuring `=this.themefeature`
Rooms:  How many Rooms are there? `=this.roomtotal`
Floors:  How many floors are there?  These can be above or below ground. `=this.floortotal`
Appropriate challenge for `=this.playercount` level `=this.playerlvl` players.
The dungeon should be non-linear and allow for multiple pathways.
There should be options for roleplaying.

Each room should have a description that could be read by the dungeon master.
If appropriate, list which monsters would be in each room.
If appropriate, list what treasure would be found in each room (coin, mundane weapons, art pieces, magical items, items that help define the lore of the location, or mysterious items that act as quest hooks)

# ART PROMPTS
## Prompt 1

I am a AI Art Prompt Writer for making DnD Art. I need you to take descriptions of what I give you, and turn them into usable prompts that would be used for Midjourney AI or for Stable Diffusion Art Generators. 

Do you understand?

## Prompt 2

Today were are working on making art for a dungeon called "**The Abyssal Maw**"

This is the base description of the Dungeon and the environment we are trying to create when making prompts.

**Description:** The Abyssal Maw is a sprawling subterranean labyrinth, its walls slick with moisture and strange glowing fungi providing dim illumination. The air is thick with the scent of decay and the distant echoes of feral magic reverberate through the corridors. Ancient carvings depict scenes of eldritch rituals and monstrous beings.

Do you understand the information and what kind of prompts will be needed to be generate to achieve this art?
