| **Strange Form of Fungus** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 1                          | Harmless fungi expel hallucinogenic spores, causing affected characters to act irrationally, such as wandering off, attacking objects or party members, or remaining motionless for hours.                                  |
| 2                          | Consuming this fungus grants strange properties like growing to gigantic size, glowing in the dark, understanding any language, healing damage, seeing in darkness, detecting invisible creatures, or breathing underwater. |
| 3                          | Eating this fungus infects the eater, turning their body into a spongy mass over 24 hours, resulting in loss of strength and resistance to damage. If not cured within 24 hours, the character dies and cannot be revived.  |
| 4                          | Fungus colony possesses a hive mind and can telepathically communicate. It offers knowledge about the dungeon in exchange for odd services, expressed in alien terms.                                                       |
| 5                          | This fungus feeds off magic, draining charges from magical items, disenchants potions, causes casters to forget spells, etc. Casting magic prompts sudden fungus growth, entangling the party or closing exits.             |
| 6                          | The fungus colony ambulates through the dungeon, consuming organic matter in its path, either slowly creeping or surging like a horde of ambulatory toadstools, knocking down obstacles.                                    |
| 7                          | The fungus exudes a sticky slime, and contact risks adherence. Struggling further entraps the adventurer until escape is impossible.                                                                                        |
| 8                          | Harmless fungus with unusual characteristics, like singing or swaying as if in a breeze.                                                                                                                                    |
