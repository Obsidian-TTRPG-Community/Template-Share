They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.

## Corrupt Laws
 What law exists here is for sale, or does not apply to certain favored groups or castes.

An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about.

## Decadent Locals
 The locals enjoy repulsive vices and shameful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their evils, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with things worse than humans.

A few weathered tokens of old glory remain, and some may be jealously maintained, but there simply aren't enough locals left to keep up what they've inherited. 

- **E:** Looter seeking to plunder the remains, Zealot with a plan to return to glory, Outsider strongman who wants to coerce the locals into obedience

## Enemy Within
 The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shapeshifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they've always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.

They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign city conquered within the relatively recent past.

- **P:** Public building in an aggressively different architectural style, Outsider home surrounded by local-style buildings, Civic gathering place of a kind specific to the locals

## Heavy Fortification
 The community is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strongpoints inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community's suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.

- **P:** Oversized weapon emplacement, Top of a looming city wall, Stronghold keep at the center of the community

## Guild Oligarchy
 While the community might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.

- **P:** Bustling guild hall, Purely decorative ruler's court, Shabby worker's housing

## Hidden Ruler

- **E:** Secret cult-backed leader, Nefarious agent of an enemy power, Minor functionary who is actually the hidden master

- **P:** Unassuming tavern that's a secret headquarters, Tense court of the official ruler, Hidden site where the secret government meets

## Hostile Terrain
 The community is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of arratu, or some other harmful topography. The community might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger. The terrain might have formed at some time since the founding, with the citizens struggling to make terms with the new danger. 

- **E:** Bandit chief hiding in the terrain, Monstrous leader in the badlands, Local who's made a secret deal with the terrain's vile inhabitants

- **F:** Canny badland guide, Innocent researcher eager to explore, Grizzled chief engineer of the community's anti-terrain measures

- **C:** The terrain is growing somehow, The terrain offers some special profit as well as danger, The community is being crushed by the terrain

- **T:** Treasure lost within the terrain, Device that generates or protects against the terrain, Precious resource found within the terrain

- **P:** Edge of the community overtaken by the environment, Building fortified against the terrain, Tavern favored by terrain guides and explorers

## Inherited Architecture
 Many of the community's structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath the community's streets. 

- **E:** A Thing from Below, Outside pillager bent on sacking the structures, Reckless explorer opening up things best left sealed

- **F:** Heir to the ancient arts of maintenance, Chief of the local structure guard patrol, Keeper of a particularly useful structure

- **C:** The locals mine treasures from the buried depths, The structures were built by Outsiders, They require dark sacrifices to keep functioning

- **T:** Key to unlock a sealed structure, Artifact of the ancient lost people, Map to a hidden structure

- **P:** Mundane business in a remarkable building, Ancient structure retrofitted into a habitation, Buried ancient street within a cavern

## Incompetent Leaders
 The community is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pig- headed obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post. 

- **E:** Heir who is totally unsuited to their new rule, Disinterested ruler forced on them by their overlord, Charismatic ninny with ridiculous plans

- **F:** Deposed former leader, Desperate local elder, Victim of one of their bungled plans

- **C:** An outside rival is backing the fool, The idiot has tremendous institutional legitimacy, They provide a critical skill or ability unrelated to ruling

- **T:** Embezzled funds from a failed plan, Precious artifact lost through incompetence, Regalia of critical importance to the ruler's legitimacy

- **P:** Chaotic and ill-kept court, Site of abject disaster, Plaza full of grumbling locals

## Inhuman Cooperation
 The locals have a deal with some manner of inhuman power, either remnant Outsiders, eldritch entities, nearby monstrous beings, or some other creature generally feared or hated by humans. It may actually be a peaceful exchange, but more likely it involves acts and sacrifices that other humans would refuse. If not secret, this deal is valuable enough to make the community's suzerain avert their eyes, or it may be a bargain so old that time has sanctified it to their neighbors. 

- **E:** Sinister overseer of the bargain's price, Local magnate growing rich off the dark bargain, Alien entity seeking to expand the terms of the deal

- **F:** Victim of the bargain's price, Outside investigator seeking the truth, Inveterate hunter of the entity's type come to purge the evil

- **C:** The bargain is actually reasonably fair and decent, The locals don't want the bargain but their neighbors profit by it and so force them into it, However bad the creatures are they're actually better than the human lord

- **T:** Valuable alien goods, Wealth offered as a sacrifice, Treasure gained by cooperation

- **P:** Secret meeting hall for the creatures, Prosperous front business, Sinister ritual of sacrifice

## Lawless Class
 Some class of citizen is either tacitly or explicitly above the law. They may only be subject to punishment for crimes against their own kind, or they may be entirely immune to legal prosecution. In some cases, this immunity may be the product of official indifference rather than high status; some untouchable classes may be considered so lowly that their slaughter of each other isn't worth punishing unless it inconveniences their betters. 

- **E:** Professionally immune provocateur, Cruelly indulgent elite, Grasping mercantile oligarch

- **F:** Hapless magistrate, Avenger outside the law, Victim of an unpunishable crime

- **C:** The lawless themselves enforce the law, The immune are most dangerous to each other, Special servants of the immune also are immune

- **T:** Wealth stolen from a hapless victim, Evidence that an abuser is not legitimately part of the class, Token that grants the bearer the same immunity

- **P:** Courtroom where some cases are swiftly dismissed, Site of a gaudily obvious exercise of immunity, Shop where the business was ruined by their excesses

## Magical Academy
 While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can sometimes be had even in remote villages, this community is unusual in that it has an actual school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it's probably isolated or well-fortified. 

- **E:** Amoral headmaster, Secretly monstrous school patron, Unpleasantly talented yet vicious elite student

- **F:** Plucky young apprentice, Harried but earnest teacher, Instructor with useful side obsession

- **C:** The academy is patronized by the ruling class, The community grew around the academy, The rulers don't trust the wizards but find them too useful to get rid of them

- **T:** Long-lost grimoire of power, Brilliant artifice of a genius student, Magical key to a dark power the academy keeps locked up

- **P:** Battered magical laboratory, Architecturally impossible chamber, Grubby student lodgings

## Martial Tradition
 The natives have a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise. 

- **E:** Ruthlessly amoral military leader, Obsessive martial academy master, Outsider using the locals as brute muscle

- **F:** Determined local defender, Petitioner in need of their prowess, Keeper of the local martial way

- **C:** They use weapons only they are able to employ, They've bled themselves white in gaining glory, They're eager to conquer their neighbors

- **T:** Enchanted weapon related to their way, Plunder taken in a victorious war, Venerated battle harness of a legendary hero

- **P:** Busy training ground, Cemetery with many memorials, City hall decorated with the banners of the vanquished

## Mistreated Blighted
 Not all Blighted are violent; many are simply cursed with disabilities or mental compulsions implanted in them by their creators. The locals here have a useful kind of Blighted that provides some valuable service; brute labor, companionship, or more awful fates for those with precious organic components. The locals treat them as nothing but expendable chattel, but the Blighted are unable to effectively defend themselves or survive without the support of their tormentors. 

- **E:** Bloodless local slaver, Faux-benevolent overseer, Reformer seeking a complete purge of them

- **F:** Blighted leader, Troubled local, Native seeking to take over the work niche the Blighted are filling

- **C:** The Blighted are emotionally addicted to this kind of servitude, The Blighted could be very dangerous if they got free, Criminals and the unwanted are transformed into the Blighted

- **T:** Device that imposes the Blight on a victim, Wealth earned by Blighted suffering, Key to the method used to control the Blighted

- **P:** Workhouse full of cruelly-used Blighted, Stately mansion with rigidly-disciplined Blighted servants, Sinister establishment staffed by disposable Blighted

## Miserable Penury
 Life is hard in the Latter Earth, but it is exceptionally hard here. People are deprived of all but the barest necessities, and even the local gentry are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. 

- **E:** Rapacious beggar-lord oppressing even poorer lessers, Outsider who's siphoning off wealth, Brutal gang leader determined to take what they want

- **F:** Plucky young entrepreneur, Charitable cleric, Suzerain's envoy seeking to improve things

- **C:** They could be richer if they abandon a defining cultural tradition, They're being bled dry by outsiders, They're hopelessly resigned

- **T:** A stash of wealth that would be minor elsewhere, Desperately needed resources, A cherished relic that had to be sold for survival's sake

- **P:** Miserable slum of shanties, Unprofitable fields, Tavern with only the barest minimum of fare

## Monstrous Tribute
 The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some vile tribute in exchange for the being's forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn't offer any further inducement or aid. 

- **E:** Ancient artificial intellect-tyrant, Cruel sorcererlord, Monstrous quasi-god

- **F:** Secret rebel against the deal, Investigator looking for evidence, Monstrous rival of the tyrant

- **C:** They seize the tribute from their neighbors or enemies, The deal is getting progressively worse, Their neighbors are thinking of making their own deals

- **T:** Ritual instruments forged via atrocity, Forbidden book of hideous truths, Precious resource generated by the entity

- **P:** Secret shrine to their unholy master, Prison where the tribute is kept, Bustling town street full of sinister prosperity

## Neglectful Ruler
 The community can't rely on its ostensible suzerain. Whatever lord claims ownership of the place is indifferent to its troubles and pays no attention to its civic disorder. The lord may be incapable of giving help, or convinced their representative can handle it alone, or actively seeking to punish the community for some rebellion or failure of service. 

- **E:** A viceroy sending back false reports, Local grandee seizing control by violence, Cruel local lord who keeps the ruler pacified with tax money

- **F:** Inspector from the suzerain, Local judge seeking justice, Harried representative in need of help

- **C:** The ruler has too many problems to care about this place, The ruler would actually make things worse if they paid heed, The ruler's authority is being hindered by some rival power

- **T:** Tax money not yet sent, A "gift" meant to draw the lord's help, Proof of a plot to seize control of the community

- **P:** Deserted courtroom, Street crawling with local vigilante groups, Burnt-out home of a political loser

## Pilgrimage Site
 The community is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors. 

- **E:** Outsider boss seeking to seize control of the site, Corrupt hereditary site controller, Rival saboteur bent on despoiling the site

- **F:** Well-meaning pilgrim, Scholar with dangerous historical theories, Earnest caretaker of the site

- **C:** The site can only handle so many visitors without degrading, The pilgrimage site is dangerous, The keepers don't fully understand the site

- **T:** Precious relic of the site, Beautifully-made fake of some critical relic, Secret true history of the site

- **P:** Expensive pilgrim lodgings, Street full of hawkers of pilgrimage tokens, Alien and wondrous pilgrimage site

## New Industry
 The natives have established a new industry here, and it's making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits. 

- **E:** Arrogant and ruthless new oligarch, Scheming old-money grandee, Grasping and heartless industrial magnate

- **F:** Hopeful new entrepreneur, Local elder trying to deal with the change, Innocently naive outside investor

- **T:** Profit from the industry, A valuable device to improve the industry, Tools of sabotage

- **P:** Retrofitted old workshop, Resource-extraction site, Crowded worker housing

## Plagued City
 The community is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn't so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long- lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It's probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same. 

- **E:** Charlatan selling false hope, Merciless grandee gladly worsening the plague for profit, Dark sorcerer seeking to weaponize the sickness

- **F:** Traditional healer wise in the plague's ways, Appealing waif struck down by the illness, Impassioned healer seeking a real cure

- **C:** The plague has a positive side-effect, Only certain classes suffer the plague, Passage into or out of the community is strictly controlled

- **T:** A real cure for the plague, Hidden wealth of a plague victim, The key to halting the cycle

- **P:** Worn-down sickhouse full of locals, Cemetery overflowing with the dead, Business based on providing for a sufferer's special needs

## Population Boom
 A vast influx of newcomers has recently rushed into the community. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary. 

- **E:** Viciously xenophobic grandee, Newcomer leader who despises the locals and their ways, Grasping merchant exploiting one or both groups

- **F:** Local trying to bridge differences, Newcomer trying to make a new life, Local official trying to keep the peace

- **C:** The newcomers act like conquerors, Their cultures are extremely imiscible, The natives are now highly dependent on newcomer industry

- **T:** Precious relic brought by the newcomers, Loot confiscated or extracted from the newcomers, Riches earned from newcomer labor

- **P:** Jarringly different newcomer quarter, Market with informally segregated areas, Tavern welcoming to only one group

## Rebel Stronghold
 The community is in tacit or open revolt against their supposed overlord. If it's distant from their suzerain's power centers or exceptionally well-fortified, they might be an open nest of rebels and provide overt support to their ruler's enemies. More vulnerable communities will provide shelter, secret support, and a base of supply for hidden bands of insurgents. Loyalist locals must keep their sympathies hidden or suffer the consequences. 

- **E:** Psychopathic but charismatic rebel leader, Savage rebel-suppressing general, Traitor leading the rebels to their doom

- **F:** Idealistic young rebel, Frightened local just trying to survive, Sympathetic outside mediator

- **C:** One side of the dispute is correct but profoundly unsympathetic, A rebel victory would ultimately be catastrophic, The lord can't afford the disruption that violent suppression would create

- **T:** Cache of valuable rebel supplies, Tax money stolen by the rebels, Secret rebel identities and plans

- **P:** Rebel base hidden outside the community, Tavern full of sympathizers, Burnt house of a loyalist

## Raider Scourge
 Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but this community is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings. 

- **E:** Would-be ruler turned bandit chief, Rival agent backing the bandits, Traitorous native wielding the bandits against their enemies

- **F:** Runaway ex-bandit, Embittered victim of their plundering, Merchant desperate for help

- **P:** Scene of gory slaughter on the road, Burnt farmstead outside the community, Makeshift and dirty bandit camp

## Rigid Castes
 The locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals. 

- **E:** Conqueror seeking to impose "civilized" castes on outsiders, Impostor who'll commit any crime to conceal their true caste, Abusive upper-caste grandee

- **F:** Unfairly mistreated caste member, Determined reformer with a "better" caste plan, Outsider trying to undo the caste system

- **C:** The castes are marked by ancient physiological alterations, Even the low caste locals are convinced the tradition is right, Exceptional money or talent can change a person's caste

- **T:** Proof of a group's real caste, Goods created by a caste's unpaid labors, Sacred regalia only a certain caste can touch

- **P:** Caste-divided residential quarters, Temple dedicated to a caste, Workshop of a caste

## Scars Of War
 The community is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat. 

- **E:** Savage tyrant left over from the fight, Outsider taking advantage of their weakness, Native driven to extremes by their losses

- **F:** Bedraggled survivor, Outsider who's come to help, Relative of someone lost in the battle

- **T:** Plunder taken during the fight, Wealth left behind by the dead, A cache of treasure concealed by looters

- **P:** Damaged half-occupied house, Burnt-down civil structure, Fields pocked with torched cottages

## Secret Treachery
 The community is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community's leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they'll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor. 

- **E:** Suspicious investigator from the tyrant, Scheming local chief who plans to be the new lord, Monstrous thing that they made a pact with

- **P:** Smoky back room, Sullen public gathering, Secret chamber in a leader's home

## Seat Of Rule
 Some important ruler or leading figure resides in the community. This may be the seat of a regional lord, or it could be the traditional residence of a high priest, great magus, merchant house, or other wielder of influence. The community itself may or may not be under their direct control, but the wishes of the august figure must be acknowledged by the locals. 

- **E:** Corrupted and venal ruling figure, Conspiring usurper of the role, Vicious rebel against the ruler

- **F:** Worried advisor to the ruler, Petitioner seeking help, Rebel against an unjust ruler

- **T:** Riches brought to petition the ruler, Ancestral ruling regalia, Treasure hidden by a ruler of old

- **P:** Grand and ancient audience hall, Elaborate edifice now no longer used, Public building related to the ruler's role

## Sinking City
 The community was built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that's now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community's present structure is ruined. 

- **E:** Unspeakable evil from below, Ruthless local causing damage for the sake of profit, Outside exploiter preying on the displaced

- **P:** Pit where a manor once was, Fallen city wall, Freshly-exposed underworks

## Theocratic Authorities
 Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but here they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion's believers. 

- **E:** Rebel backed by a rival religion, Heretical priest trying to usurp authority, Eldritch being masquerading as a heavenly envoy

- **F:** Well-meaning but zealous priest, Insurgent against a wicked theocracy, Harried town leader trying to please the clerics

- **P:** Ornate and splendid temple, Shrine room within an ordinary house, Magistrate-priest's courtroom

## Trade Hub
 The site is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It's probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes. 

- **E:** Cheating merchant prince, Corrupt judge or trade official, Grasping ruler with heavy taxes

- **F:** Confused foreigner with strange ways, Dealer in some vital adventuring good, Exotic stranger in need of help

- **P:** Bazaar full of alien speech, Caravansary built in a foreign fashion, Palace of conspicuous opulence

## Toxic Economy
 The community is reliant on an industry or product that has toxic or negative side-effects as part of its production. The good is extremely valuable, or the community is extremely desperate, and the side- effects are endured as a necessary evil. It may be that their neighbors or lord are forcing them to produce the good so that they aren't the ones suffering the cost. 

- **E:** Cruel sorcerer-merchant, Indifferent magnate wringing more production out of people, Trader in flesh who profits by the sick and feeble

- **P:** Pesthouse full of the crippled, Splendid mansion built off the product's profits, Factory full of lethal fumes and effects

## Unique Product
 The community produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities. 

- **E:** Magnate forcing more production at a grim cost, Ruler demanding more tribute, Rival saboteur planning to turn the product dangerous

- **F:** Naive but superbly talented artisan, Innovator seeking to improve the product, Outside trader trying to protect their deal

- **P:** Factory full of busy creators, Resource extraction field where a vital component is gathered, Market crowded with traders from far places

## Upstart Faith
 There's a relatively new religion in the community which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community. 

- **E:** False prophet gathering thralls, Hostile native cleric with dark plans, Outside manipulator profiting by the strife

- **P:** Hastily-made new temple, Now-empty existing shrine, Market with informal religious segregation

## Widespread Prosperity
 The community is uncommonly rich, not only for the gentry but for the common citizens as well. They may produce a valuable good, oversee precious resource extraction, have special economic favors from the ruler, or simply have inherited a vast body of infrastructure. Their neighbors likely view them with envy, and outside raiders and exploiters find them an ideal target. 

- **E:** Cunning raider chieftain, Greedy overlord, Arrogant local ruler over-proud of their wealth

- **F:** Local being exploited for their wealth, Agent of the local prosperity's maintenance, Outside trader trying to make an honest profit

- **P:** Commoner neighborhood as opulent as that of the gentry of elsewhere, Market full of luxuries, Edifice of unusually advanced infrastructure

## Warring Council
 There's more than one leader in the community, but at least some of them are at each other's throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that's boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved. 

- **E:** Shadowy kingmaker bent on breaking resistance, Megalomaniacal new leader, "Owned" leader forced to fight for his backers

- **T:** Blackmail on a leader, Treasure being fought over, Item that would resolve the struggle

- **P:** Now-abandoned council room, Site of a steadily-increasing problem, Tavern stronghold of one of the combatants

## Xenophobic Locals
 The locals despise outsiders. For some "outsiders" may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. Almost every community in the Latter Earth has some degree of wariness toward strangers, but these locals have an active loathing, and the few outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage. 

- **E:** Utterly unfair local magistrate, Local magnate who abuses outside laborers, Leader who always paints outsiders in the worst possible light

- **F:** Secretly curious local, Cruelly mistreated outsider living there, Grudging diplomat seeking a modus vivendi
