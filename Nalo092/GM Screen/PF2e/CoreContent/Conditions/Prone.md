# Prone

You're lying on the ground. You are [[Off-Guard]] and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are [[Crawl]] and [[Stand]]. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can [[Take Cover]] while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain off-guard).

If you would be knocked prone while you're [[Climb|Climbing]] or [[2-Mechanics/Character Building/Spells/Fly|Flying]], you fall. You can't be knocked prone when [[2-Mechanics/Character Building/Actions/Swim|Swimming]].
