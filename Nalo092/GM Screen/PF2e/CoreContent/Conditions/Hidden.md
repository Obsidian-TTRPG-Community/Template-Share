# Hidden
![[systems-pf2e-icons-conditions-hidden.webp]]

While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. You typically become hidden by using Stealth to [[Hide]]. When [[Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than [[Observed]]. A creature you're hidden from is [[Off-Guard]] to you, and it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.

A creature might be able to use the seek action to try to observe you.
