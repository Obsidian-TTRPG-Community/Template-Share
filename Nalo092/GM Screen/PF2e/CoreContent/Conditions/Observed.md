# Observed
![[systems-pf2e-icons-conditions-observed.webp]]

Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using Stealth to [[Hide]], it can become [[Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected]] instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When [[Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than observed.
