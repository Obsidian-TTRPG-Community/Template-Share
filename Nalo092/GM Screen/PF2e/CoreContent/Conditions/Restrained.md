# Restrained

You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the [[Off-Guard]] and [[Immobilized]] conditions, and you can't use any actions with the attack or manipulate traits except to attempt to [[Escape]] or [[2-Mechanics/Rule References/Force Open]] your bonds. Restrained overrides [[Grabbed]].
