# Invisible
![[systems-pf2e-icons-conditions-invisible.webp]]

While invisible, you can't be seen. You're [[rules/conditions.md#Undetected|Undetected]] to everyone. Creatures can [[Seek]] to attempt to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your Stealth DC, you become [[Hidden]] to that creature until you [[Sneak]] to become undetected again. If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out hidden to the observer (instead of undetected) until you successfully sneak. You can't become [[Observed]] while invisible except via special abilities or magic.
