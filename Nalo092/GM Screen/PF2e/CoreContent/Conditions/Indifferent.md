# Indifferent
![[systems-pf2e-icons-conditions-indifferent.webp]]

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is indifferent to a character doesn't really care one way or the other about that character. Assume a creature's attitude to a given character is indifferent unless specified otherwise.
