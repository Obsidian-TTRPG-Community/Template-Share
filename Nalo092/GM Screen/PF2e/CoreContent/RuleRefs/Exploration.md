# Overview
An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

# Actions

## Affix a Talisman
**Source** [_Player Core pg. 439_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=216)  
**Requirements** You must use a [repair toolkit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2747)

---

You spend 10 minutes affixing a [talisman](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=155) to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair toolkit with both hands. You can also use this activity to remove a talisman. Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
## Avoid Notice
---

You attempt a **Stealth** check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their **Perception DCs**, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).

## Borrow an Arcane Spell

---

If you're an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else's arcane spellbook, arcane witch familiar, or the like. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell's rank and rarity; it's typically a bit easier than [Learning the Spell](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=25).  
  
**Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.  
**Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to borrow this spell again until the next time you prepare spells.

## Call Companion
---

You spend 1 minute calling for a different animal companion, switching your active companion for another of your animal companions.

## Cleanse Soul 

---

You meditate, pray, or otherwise try to reinforce your soul's connection. This takes 10 minutes. Attempt a [[Counteract]] check against your soul corruption. The counteract level is half your level rounded up, and the counteract check modifier is your **Religion** modifier. If successful, reduce the stage of your _soulforged corruption_ by 1 (to a minimum of Stage 1).

## Coerce
[Auditory] [Concentrate] [Emotion] [Exploration] [Linguistic] [Mental]

---

With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a creature into doing what you want. You must spend at least 1 minute of conversation with the creature. At the end of the conversation, attempt an [Intimidation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=7) check against the target's Will DC, modified by any circumstances the GM determines. (The attitudes referenced in the effects below are summarized in the Changing Attitudes sidebar and described in full in the [Conditions Appendix](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2455).)  
  
**Critical Success** The target gives you the information you seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they aren't likely to harm the target in any way. The target continues to comply for an amount of time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target becomes [unfriendly](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=40) (if it wasn't already unfriendly or [hostile](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=23)). However, the target is too scared of you to retaliate—at least in the short term.  
**Success** As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting your enemies.  
**Failure** The target doesn't do what you say, and if they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.  
**Critical Failure** The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile if they weren't already, and is temporarily immune to your Coercion for at least 1 week.

### Changing Attitudes

Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The attitudes are detailed in the [Conditions Appendix](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2455) and are summarized here.

- **[Helpful](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=21)**: Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests.
- **[Friendly](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=18)**: Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
- **[Indifferent](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=25)**: Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.)
- **[Unfriendly](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=40)**: Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you.
- **[Hostile](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=23)**: Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.

No one can ever change the attitude of a player character with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with player characters, and even use [Diplomacy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=6) results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate decisions about how their characters respond.

## Cover Tracks

[Concentrate] [Exploration] [Move]

---

You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed. You don't need to attempt a **Survival** check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a **Survival** check against your **Survival DC** if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.  
  
In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.

## Decipher Writing

[Concentrate] [Secret]

---

You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an obscure topic. This usually takes 1 minute per page of text, but might take longer (typically an hour per page for decrypting ciphers or the like). The text must be in a language you can read, though the GM might allow you to attempt to decipher text written in an unfamiliar language using [Society](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=14) instead.  
  
The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger text.  
  
**Critical Success** You understand the true meaning of the text.  
**Success** You understand the true meaning of the text. If it was a coded document, you know the general meaning but might not have a word-for-word translation.  
**Failure** You can't understand the text and take a –2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher it.  
**Critical Failure** You believe you understand the text on that page, but you have in fact misconstrued its message.


## Follow the Expert

[Auditory] [Concentrate] [Exploration] [Visual

---

Choose an ally attempting a recurring skill check while exploring, such as climbing, or performing a different exploration tactic that requires a skill check (like [Avoiding Notice](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=511)). The ally must be at least an expert in that skill and must be willing to provide assistance. While Following the Expert, you match their tactic or attempt similar skill checks.  
  
Thanks to your ally's assistance, you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the associated skill check, even if you're untrained. Additionally, you gain a circumstance bonus to your skill check based on your ally's proficiency (+2 for expert, +3 for master, and +4 for legendary).

## Gather Information

[Exploration] [Secret]

---

You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes, drinks, or gifts.  
  
**Success** You collect information about the individual or topic. The GM determines the specifics.  
**Critical Failure** You collect incorrect information about the individual or topic.


## Identify Alchemy

[Concentrate] [Secret]
**Requirements** You are holding or wearing an alchemist's toolkit

---

You can identify the nature of an [alchemical](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=6) item with 10 minutes of testing using your alchemist's toolkit. If your attempt is interrupted in any way, you must start over.  
  
**Success** You identify the item and the means of activating it.  
**Failure** You fail to identify the item but can try again.  
**Critical Failure** You misidentify the item as another item of the GM's choice.

## Identify Magic

[Concentrate] [Exploration] [Secret]

---

Once you discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect is magical, you can spend 10 minutes to try to identify the particulars of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check. Cursed magic or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using this activity alone. Heightening a spell doesn't increase the DC to identify it.  
  
**Critical Success** You learn all the attributes of the magic, including its name (for an effect), what it does, any means of activating it (for an item or location), and whether it is cursed.  
**Success** For an item or location, you get a sense of what it does and learn any means of activating it. For an ongoing effect (such as a spell with a duration), you learn the effect's name and what it does. You can't try again in hopes of getting a critical success.  
**Failure** You fail to identify the magic and can't try again for 1 day.  
**Critical Failure** You misidentify the magic as something else of the GM's choice.


## Impersonate

[Concentrate] [Exploration] [Manipulate] [Secret   

---

You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a [disguise kit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=19), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you're not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM's discretion.  
  
In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the [Seek](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84) action to attempt Perception checks against your [Deception](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5) DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a [secret](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=142) Deception check for you against that creature's Perception DC instead.  
  
If you're disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you're imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren't directly interacting with others.  
  
**Success** You trick the creature into thinking you're the person you're disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.  
**Failure** The creature can tell you're not who you claim to be.  
**Critical Failure** The creature can tell you're not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.

## Investigate

[Concentrate] [Exploration]

---

You seek out information about your surroundings while traveling at half speed. You use [Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26) as a [secret](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=142) check to discover clues among the various things you can see and engage with as you journey along. You can use any skill that has a Recall Knowledge action while Investigating, but the GM determines whether the skill is relevant to the clues you could find.

## Learn a Spell

[Concentrate] [Exploration]   
**Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list

---

You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a [cleric](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=5) with the [bard multiclass](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=3) archetype, you couldn't use [Religion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=13) to add an [occult](https://2e.aonprd.com/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3) spell to your bardic spell repertoire.  
  
To learn the spell, you must do the following:

- Spend 1 hour per spell rank, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
- Have materials with the Price indicated in the Learning a Spell table.
- Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on the Learning a Spell Table). Uncommon or rare spells have higher DCs; full guidelines for the GM appear on page 52 of GM Core.

  
**Critical Success** You expend half the materials and learn the spell.  
**Success** You expend the materials and learn the spell.  
**Failure** You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you gain a level. The materials aren't expended.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, except you expend half the materials.

### Table 4-3: Learning a Spell

| **Spell Level** | **Price** | **Typical DC** |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 1st or cantrip  | 2 gp      | 15             |
| 2nd             | 6 gp      | 18             | 
| 3rd             | 16 gp     | 20             |
| 4th             | 36 gp     | 23             |
| 5th             | 70 gp     | 26             |
| 6th             | 140 gp    | 28             |
| 7th             | 300 gp    | 31             |
| 8th             | 650 gp    | 34             |
| 9th             | 1,500 gp  | 36             |
| 10th            | 7,000 gp  | 41             |

### Learned Spells

A spell you learn is added to your repository of spells, such as a spellbook for a wizard, familiar for a witch, or spell list for a cleric or druid. If you have a spell repertoire, such as a bard, it's not automatically added since you can only know a limited number of spells. Instead, you can select it when you add or swap spells.


## Repair

[Exploration [Manipulate]
**Requirements** You are holding or wearing a repair toolkit

---

You spend 10 minutes attempting to fix a damaged item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair toolkit with both hands. Roll a [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) check. The GM sets the DC, but it's usually about the same DC to Repair a given item as it is to [Craft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=43) it in the first place. You can't Repair a destroyed item.  
  
**Critical Success** You restore 10 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional 10 Hit Points per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (a total of 20 HP if you're trained, 30 HP if you're an expert, 40 HP if you're a master, or 50 HP if you're legendary).  
**Success** You restore 5 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional 5 per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (for a total of 10 HP if you are trained, 15 HP if you're an expert, 20 HP if you're a master, or 25 HP if you're legendary).  
**Critical Failure** You deal 2d6 damage to the item. Apply the item's Hardness to this damage.
