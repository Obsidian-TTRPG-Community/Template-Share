**Calculating the DC and Counteract Level**

| If the effect is a magical hazard | The DC is in the hazard's stat block. | The counteract level is the spell level. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| If the effect is a spell (including Afflictions caused by a spell) | If you know caster's DC | The DC is the Caster's DC. The counteract level is the spell level. |
|  | If you don't know caster's DC | The DC is Level-Based. The counteract level is the spell level. |
| If the effect is an Affliction If you know Affliction's DC | The DC is in the Affliction's stat block. | The counteract level is half the source's level rounded up. |
|  | If you don't know Affliction's DC | The DC is Level-Based. The counteract level is half the source's level rounded up. |

**Calculating Countercheck Modifier and Countercheck Level**

| If you are using a spell to counteract an effect | Add your spellcasting proficiency bonus plus your spellcasting ability modifier, plus any bonuses and penalties that specifially apply to counteract checks. Your counteract level is your spell's level. |
| --- | --- |
| If you aren't using a spell to counteract an effect | Add the relevant skill modifier or other appropriate modifier to your check. If you are using an item effect not based on a spell, the counteract level is half the source's level rounded up. Otherwise, your counteract level is half your level rounded up. |

Roll a d20 and apply modifiers. Make a check against the effect's DC and determine results;

# Counteracting

Some effects try to counteract spells, afflictions, conditions, or other effects. Counteract checks compare the power of two forces and determine which defeats the other. Successfully counteracting an effect ends it unless noted otherwise.

When attempting a counteract check, add the relevant skill modifier or other appropriate modifier to your check against the target's DC. If you're counteracting an affliction, the DC is in the affliction's stat block. If it's a spell, use the caster's DC. The GM can also calculate a DC based on the target effect's level. For spells, the counteract check modifier is your spellcasting ability modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus, plus any bonuses and penalties that specifically apply to counteract checks. What you can counteract depends on the check result and the target's level. If an effect is a spell, its level is the counteract level. Otherwise, halve its level and round up to determine its counteract level. If an effect's level is unclear and it came from a creature, halve and round up the creature's level.

| **Counteract Results** |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical Success** | Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 3 levels higher than your effect's counteract level. |
| **Success** | Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 1 level higher than your effect's counteract level. |
| **Failure** | Counteract the target if its counteract level is lower than your effect's counteract level. |
| **Critical Failure** | You fail to counteract the target. |
