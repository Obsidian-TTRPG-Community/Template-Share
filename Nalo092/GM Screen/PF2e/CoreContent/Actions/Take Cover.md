# Take Cover `pf2:1`

You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of cover. If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves against area effects; and to **Stealth** checks to **Hide**, **Sneak**, or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an **attack** action, become [[**unconscious**]], or end this effect as a free action.
