# Ready `pf2:2`

You prepare to use an action that will occur outside your turn. Choose a single action or free action you can use, and designate a trigger. Your turn then ends. If the trigger you designated occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a reaction (provided you still meet the requirements to use it). You can't Ready a free action that already has a trigger.  
  
If you have a multiple attack penalty and your readied action is an **attack** action, your readied attack takes the [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you had at the time you used **Ready**. This is one of the few times the multiple attack penalty applies when it's not your turn.
