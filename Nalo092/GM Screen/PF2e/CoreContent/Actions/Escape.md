# Escape `pf2:1`

You attempt to escape from being [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Restrained]]. Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your unarmed attack modifier against the DC of the effect. This is typically the **Athletics** DC of a creature grabbing you, the **Thievery** DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an **Acrobatics** or Athletics check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the **attack** trait).  
  
**Critical Success** You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target. You can then Stride up to 5 feet.  
**Success** You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target.  
**Critical Failure** You don’t get free, and you can’t attempt to Escape again until your next turn.
