# Healer's Gel (Moderate)

**Activate** Cast a Spell

* * *

An astringent aroma from rare succulent plants wafts off these soothing cloth patches. Adding this material component to a heal spell bestows an additional 10 temporary Hit Points to one target healed by the spell. These temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.
