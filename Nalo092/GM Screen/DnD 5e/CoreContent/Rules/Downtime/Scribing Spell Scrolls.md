# Scribing Spell Scrolls (XGtE)

If you're like me and worried about wasting your precious spell slots, then you should try your hand at making spell scrolls. In order to make spell scrolls you need proficiency in arcana, the ability to cast spells, time, gold, and any material components needed for the spell. The **time** and amount of **gold** spent depend on the level for the spell; the higher the spell level the more it cost to make. Scribing spell scrolls, in my opinion, is one of the best ways of spellcasters spending their downtime, since it allows them to create a sort of toolbox of spells without having to prepare them. Although it isn't the best for casters with a fixed spell list, like sorcerers and bards, characters that can easily change their spell list, like clerics, druids, and wizards, will greatly benefit since they'll be able to cast spells that they don't have prepared. The only downside is cost, but at higher levels gold is usually not an issue. If you have enough **gold, time, and spells to cast**, try creating some spell scrolls.
