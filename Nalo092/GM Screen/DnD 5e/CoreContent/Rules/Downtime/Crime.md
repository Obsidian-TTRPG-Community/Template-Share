# Crime (XGtE)

For those rogues out there whose party won't let them be a kleptomaniac, they can spend their downtime getting a little extra coin. You can spend your downtime planning and executing a heist. First, you spend **25 gp** and a **workweek** on intel. Then you make, a series of crime related checks, such as **stealth** for not getting caught and **deception** since you got caught. The amount of successful checks determines the outcome of the heist, ranging from being caught and jailed to making it out with a small fortune. However, crime isn't easy and your DM may choose to put in some consequences. The most common ones include police investigations or a bounty on the character's head. However, if you have a plan or you know you aren't going to be staying in the town for long, then committing some crime isn't so bad.
