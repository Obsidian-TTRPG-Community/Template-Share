# Training (PHB/XGtE)

Self-improvement is important for everyone, including your character. Although the rules vary in both books, the same process is still there. First, you need to find a mentor or instructor to teach you how to do the skill. They can range from a war general teaching you how to use a certain weapon, a professor teaching you a language, or a wood elf teaching you how to survive in the wilds. By the book, you can only learn a new language or tool proficiency, but if you want to learn something other than that, you'll have to run it by your DM first. After you find your teacher, you can spend a number of **days** and **gold** learning the skill, and at the end of the process, you'll be proficient in the tool or language. If you want your character to speak a specific language or pick up a specific tool set for roleplaying reasons, then I would suggest training with your downtime.

## Training to Gain Levels (DMG)

There is a variant rule in the DMG that requires you to spend your downtime training in order to level up. First, you're going to need some xp to level up, usually after you have slayed a dragon or finished an adventure. Second, you're going to need enough gold and xp required for the level; the higher the level, the more it cost. Once you have everything, you can spend your downtime training and by the end of it, you'll level up. This variant rule is good for games where you have a lot of time between each adventures and you want to give players another option for their downtime or a better sense of progression. If you do have this variant rule active, this would probably be the best option for your downtime since leveling up gives you more spells and class skills.
