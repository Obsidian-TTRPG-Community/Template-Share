# Researching (DMG/XGtE)

If you're playing a studious wizard or a cautious ranger, then you'll want to research so you'll be prepared for the troubles ahead. You spend your downtime researching a specific subject or topic that you state at the beginning of your research. Your DM can decide how long it takes to research the subject or you can spend a **workweek** according to Xanthar's, and they may require you to make some rolls. In addition, you must pay an extra amount on top of your lifestyle expenses, ranging from +1 gold per day in the DMG or **50 gp** in the XGtE. At the end of the researching period, the DM will give information relating to your research, ranging from locations to lore to monster statistics. If you need more intel on what you're facing or the little metagamer inside you wants to get out, try researching for a bit. It never hurts to be prepared.
