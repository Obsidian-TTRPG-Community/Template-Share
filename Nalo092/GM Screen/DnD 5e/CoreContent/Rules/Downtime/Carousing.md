# Carousing
Carousing is different in the DMG and XGtE, so I made two different entries for them.

## Carousing (DMG)

 In the DMG, carousing means living a lavish life, consisting of partying, drinking, gambling, and anything that relieves stress. A player spends enough money to maintain a wealthy lifestyle, or **4 gp**, and at the end of the period, they roll on a table to see what happens. The results can range from being arrested, to falling in love, to winning money while gambling. Most players who I've seen carouse only do so because it fits in with their character, whether it be a gambling halfling or a lizardfolk who likes to party. All in all, carousing isn't a bad option, but I believe there are other things you can do with your downtime than it.

## Carousing (XGtE)

In Xanthar's Guide, carousing is a bit different. You choose whether to spend time with the lower, middle, or upper class, costing **10**, **50**, and **250 gp** per **week** respectively. If you want to spend time with the upper class, you'll either need access to the local nobility or be disguised with one. During the week you mingle, party, and socialize with members of that social class. At the end of the **week**, you gain a number of contacts within that class. Some examples are criminals in the lower class, soldiers in the middle class, and nobles in the upper class. This option is great for collecting allies and intel, especially if you are new to the area. If your character is a charismatic one who needs information, like a Bard or an Inquisitive Rogue, then I would carouse with as much as you can.
