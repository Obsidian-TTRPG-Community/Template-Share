## Crafting Non-Magical Items (PHB & XGtE)

If you have enough time, tools, and materials, you can finally put those tool proficiencies to use and create something. For everyday of downtime, you can craft up to **5 gp** worth of items and spend half the cost in raw materials. If the item you are trying to craft exceeds **5 gp**, you can make **5 gp** of progress towards it per day, and if multiple people work on it, they each add an additional **5 gp** of progress towards it. So if you have proficiency in smith's tools, you can spend **10 days** to create a great sword (**50 gp**), or if you have a friend helping you, you can create the great sword in only **5 days**. In addition, while you are crafting, you can maintain you a modest lifestyle without paying the cost or a comfortable lifestyle for half the cost. If you think **5 gp** is too little, I would follow Xanthar's Guide and increase the gp to **50 gp**.

Doing this can be a good way of getting mileage out of your tool proficiency without waiting for an opportunity. Forge Clerics can create armor and Assassins can create poisons. In my experience, it's better to create cheap and easy to make items as you will rarely have enough time to finish large projects like plate armor or a **1000 gp** spyglass(why). If you don't want to pay the lifestyle cost and you have a tool proficiency, this is probably the best thing you can do.

## Crafting Magical Items (DMG & XGtE)

Alternatively, if you're a spell caster with tool proficiencies, you can add a touch of magic to your items. Crafting a magical item is a long and complicated process. First the crafter needs to be able to cast spells, and if they're imbuing an item with a specific spell, they must be able to cast it. If the item requires a tool proficiency to make, like if you're making a magic sword, the crafter will need proficiency in said tools, like smith's tools. Second, the crafter will need a formula of the magical item. If the crafter is creating their own, home brewed item or the DM feels like it, the formula might not be needed. Third, you will need materials. Unlike non-magical items, magical items require specific materials that could take whole adventures to gather. Check with your DM to see what you need and how hard it is to gather.

Once you have all the requirements, you can finally start crafting. For the PHB, you can craft up to **25gp** worth of item per day, and as with non-magical items, having a friend will help speed up the process by 25 gp. The time it takes to craft it depends on the rarity of the magical item. For Xanthar's guide, the workweek and gold cost depend on the rarity.

  

|Item Rarity|Cost|Minimum Level|Workweeks|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Common|100 gp|3rd|1|50 gp|
|Uncommon|1000 gp|3rd|2|200 gp|
|Rare|5,000 gp|6th|10|2,000 gp|
|Very Rare|50,000 gp|11th|25|20,000 gp|
|Legendary|500,000 gp|17th|50|100,000 gp|

The item you create is up to the player and the DM. You can choose from the magical items in the DMG or you can create a unique item if both the player and the DM are okay with it. This opens up a world of possibilities for the player and lets them add personalized magical items for their character. As with crafting non-magical items, you don't have to pay the cost for a modest lifestyle or pay half for a comfortable lifestyle.
