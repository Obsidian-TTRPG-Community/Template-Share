# Performing Sacred Rights (DMG) / Religious Services (XGtE)

For all the paladins and clerics out there, you can spend your free time praising your god. If there is a temple near you that is affiliated with your god, you can spend your time performing sacred ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, and sacrifices. If you can do this for at least **ten days**, you'll be rewarded with inspiration every day for **2d6 days**. On the flip side, Xanthar's allows you to gain a different type of advantage. If you spend a **workweek** doing the aforementioned ceremonies, you could gain favor from your god or the church. These can either be favors you can ask the church, help with spellcasting costs, or divine interventions from the god/DM themselves. So when the adventure does start, you'll have a leg up on whatever trouble you'll be facing that day. If you are a cleric or paladin or your character is just super religious, I would seriously consider doing this if you have **ten days** to spare.
