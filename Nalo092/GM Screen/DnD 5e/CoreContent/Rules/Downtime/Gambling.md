# Gambling (XGtE)

Unlike carousing in the DMG, gambling throws out all the other events and lets you deal purely with money. And if you have proficiency in any of the gaming sets, like dice or card sets, then this is your time to shine. Gambling requires a **workweek** and anywhere from **10 gp** to **1000 gp**. Xanthar's requires you to roll specific skills, but if your DM allows it, you can replace them with other skills such as sleight of hand, deception, or your various gaming set proficiencies. The results can range from crippling debt to winning up to three times your bet. Overall, if you're confident in lady luck or know the tricks of the trade, gambling is a fun way of earning money.
