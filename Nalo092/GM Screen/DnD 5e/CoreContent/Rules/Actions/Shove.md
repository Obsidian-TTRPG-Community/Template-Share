# Shove

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

## Checks
The ability check to succeed on a Shove is as below:

**Shove DC** = 10 + Athletics or Acrobatics of Target

Depending on the size of the creature, the check will change. For every size **smaller** the DC decreases by 2, and for ever size **larger** the DC increases by 2.
