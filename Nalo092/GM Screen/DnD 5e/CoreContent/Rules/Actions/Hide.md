# Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide against a **Hiding DC**. If you succeed, you gain [[Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] on attack rolls, but when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

## Check
The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding.

### Passive Check

**Hiding DC** = Highest **Passive Perception** of enemies in the viewing area.

### Rolled Check
**Hiding DC** = Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check
