# Grapple
The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll:

## Checks
The Saving throw to succeed on a Grapple is as bellow:

**Grapple DC** = 10 + Athletics or Acrobatics of Target

Depending on the size of the creature, the check will change. For every size **smaller** and the DC increases by 2.


# Escaping a Grapple
A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (**Athletics**) or Dexterity (**Acrobatics**) check contested by your **Grapple DC**.

#  Moving a Grappled Creature
When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
