# Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. **Resistance** and then **vulnerability** are applied after all other modifiers to damage.

Multiple instances of **resistance** or **vulnerability** that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

## Resistance

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it.

For example, a creature has **resistance** to **bludgeoning** damage and is hit by an attack that deals **25** **bludgeoning** damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by **5**. The **25** damage is first reduced by **5** and then halved, so the creature takes **10** damage.

## Vulnerability

If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

For example, a creature has **vulnerability** to **bludgeoning** damage and is hit by an attack that deals **25** **bludgeoning** damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by **5**. The **25** damage is first reduced by **5** and then doubled, so the creature takes **40** damage.
