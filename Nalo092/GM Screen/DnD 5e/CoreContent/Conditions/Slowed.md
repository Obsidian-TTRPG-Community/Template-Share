# Slowed

- An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions.
- Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
- If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.
