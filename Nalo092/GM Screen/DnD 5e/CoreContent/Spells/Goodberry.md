Goodberry is a level 1 transmutation spell. This spell allows spellcasters to create magical berries which have healing properties when eaten, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Conjure four magical berries for yourself or a companion. Creatures who eat a berry regain 1d4 hit points. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.
