## prompt: Dungeon Room
Prompt: Describe a room in a fantasy dungeon. What does the room look like, smell like, sound like? What is in this room? Are there any monsters in this room? What are the entrances to this room?

If there are monsters in the room then the encounter should be listed in the exact format provided below. Remove and or change the monsters used if appropriate.
