Summarise all the text below. 

---


Alright, so let's jump in.
You guys were basically, I think for a memory you came out there and you might have gone
left.
We've done three.
Oh, you were talking about the dial direction.
That's what you were talking about.
That's what we were talking about.
Stoping up from Coraline.
So, you're talking about...
And Harry's talking about wine.
Yes.
But, I'm not...
I'm not...
And like, he...
So, he started getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.
And then all of a sudden you came on and see it.
Oh, okay.
It's bullshit.
Now, guys, that ought to be a classroom.
We try it.
Mmm.
Magic.
They've actually still look at that.
Oh, the fuck, a picture?
I've always just looking for a reason to use special forces, or some jardin wings.
Yeah.
So, is there a way for you to mark where they've gone and where they've come back?
That's what we were asked.
That's what was asked about the arrow.
We even tried marking the ground.
What a dirty, dirty, dirty, mouthful.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So, little fuckers that come and change the tiles on you.
Yeah.
So, basically, every time we entered the room, there was extra...
Extra shadows on the sundar.
Right.
And...
Yeah, correct.
So, maybe I had the flying monkey.
Yeah.
So, it's called Chad.
He did Chad.
He did Chad.
Did you just have the flying monkey?
Yes, you do.
Does the sundar move, John?
Look at these pages.
Oh, that's a good question.
Hang on.
I'm boring something.
It's the painting.
I'm a man.
Anyone out there is boring?
I don't even have starboard game pools.
I think you'd grab a text or whatever.
It's pretty much what I'm doing over the map right now once this is busy.
We've got to go off here outside.
He's going to draw a deck.
Oh, what is that, Joel?
In the full cup and both.
This is going to be...
Double cup.
That's all it is.
The full size.
I have a cup and both.
See.
What the fuck?
Yeah, that's what I said.
There's some fucking giant room magic.
You're going on there.
Alright.
So the first time you came in, it was pointing back to us.
They went that way.
Yes.
And then we went that way.
That way.
That way you came out.
Out of that corner.
Yeah.
Sorry.
What was pointing there?
The sundar.
I'm going to come back to here.
You come back to here.
Correct.
Correct.
So you lost.
There was a shutter from the sundar.
Correct.
Correct.
Correct.
And this keep was that way as well.
But we actually walk in that way.
You come in with that one behind us.
So then we turned around and walked towards the tower, basically back out the part that
we came in on and it was obviously not the same way.
And then you come back in where?
And we came back in three, four and a half.
And then there were two after doing like a two-fucking arrow to the shadows.
Right.
And there were two shadows then one pointing to the north.
And then we came back to the three o'clock.
Yep.
So we went to the three o'clock and then we came back in this corner and then just to fuck
up what we thought was a pattern there were then three arrows.
So that was, there was basically that, I think it was that one, that one and that one, not.
Like this one was gone.
Which was fun.
Yeah.
So that one was gone.
And then the next one was where you are now.
I was assuming there was going to be a pattern like, you know, you walk down that one
and came in that one.
Go out of that one and came in there.
I walked on that one.
But then that little fucked up went three appeared and that one.
What direction is the shadow pointing?
How many shadows have we got now?
We have three shadows.
So it looks like this now.
Yep.
So we have three shadows and the keep is here.
So those lines where the shadow is a pointing?
Yes.
And where's the keep?
Keep over there.
Yeah.
But you came from a direction also.
Yes.
Initially from the village.
Correct.
We entered here.
Then did it.
Then went back down.
And then came through there.
Then went that way and came in there.
And it's worked.
And now we're sitting here like with the four shadows.
Your walls of your body.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, why are they pointing?
The way they should be according to the sun.
OK.
Does the dial move?
I don't think so.
It's fixed in place.
That's a fixed in move.
It's fixed in move.
Yep.
It's pretty big something.
What ways are my shadow pointing?
Sorry.
So that's been three directions.
Currently pointing in there.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's three shadows and the sun dial pointing those three directions.
Is there any light sources we can see in the cause of each other?
Or is there sun?
There's the sun.
But you can see that the sun is like up there and your shadow is down here.
And then the shadow is from the sun dial and like completely.
Right.
So what path is my shadow pointing?
Our shadow pointing out.
It's heading in that direction.
Yep.
OK.
Helpful.
Not really.
But through which one of these paths?
It's pointing towards that side towards the map.
Yeah.
That's your physical shadow.
I had to go down.
Have you guys been through this one?
Yep.
Yeah.
You've been through that one.
Yep.
If we stand in.
I'm going through that one now that my shadow is pointing through that one.
Which one's going through that one now?
Yeah.
Even though there's no thing pointing down there.
Just quickly before we do that.
But you can always stand in front of the sun dial.
Can we still see?
But obviously our shadow blocking the sun dial can be still slightly sharper.
It's like a shark.
Oh, do you want us to tell you what we found when we walk through the first two paths first?
Yes.
That will be right.
So it's probably the first thing.
So the first thing we walked in there and then there was a big high degree.
It's just going to go ahead for the first time.
Oh, high degree.
It's nice.
Yeah.
And basically there was a gem floating in the sun.
Yeah.
No one's like that.
It was not a good high degree.
It was nothing.
Nothing.
I guess it was about one of them.
We jumped in there and there was rain and sun floating in there.
Yeah.
We finally hit it.
So it was actually pretty good.
Yeah.
So that's a good one.
So there was even a twist because it was.
Okay.
It's got what is facing.
It's got a lot of magic.
Nice.
And then Magic Red Gem floating on the surface.
Yeah.
We took nothing change.
Okay.
And then when we walked through the second path, it was, can we have the next fucking thing?
Because there were living parks down the side.
Okay.
It's how telling us that they'll pay us if we fuck off.
Okay.
And then we basically flayed them all down both sides.
Magic gem in there.
No.
No.
The wind plants died.
They dropped magic pearls.
That's it.
It was bought.
It was like, what was the first one?
The first one.
The first one was the first one.
Oh, yeah.
So basically the 10 plants we killed each of them dropped a gem.
Okay.
So we tried putting gems in the pool to see what happened.
We're going to meet at the gym.
We also have the loot from this, which Josh ate.
We have six healing potions, one potion of growth, a potion of fire bread, a one of
feed, three times plus one dang it, a drift blow, an elemental gem, which was the saffaw
for air elemental, I think it was.
Yeah.
Another area of the red gem.
The red gem, the red gem that we stole from the center of the pool previously and 12
pearls.
The red gem and the 12 pearls don't seem to be magical anymore.
Yeah.
Now we resolve the account.
Okay.
So we have the gem.
The fact that we've got a red sword is pretty dope.
Yeah.
That's pretty handy.
Two questions?
Yeah.
Are there any places on the sundial for the gems to be sent us?
Not from the other side.
Can I have one of those plus one dangs?
Yeah.
You're going to move the green one.
Well, I think the fucking thing, what direction is the shadow on the key do you think?
Hold you.
Can you try?
I can do.
I can do.
I can probably see the shadow.
I've taken one of the back fingers seeing the shadow.
It's not coming out of it.
The sun's not behind the key.
Oh, he's not going to catch up.
I'm going to do something with the other two on the road.
It's not going to be off to your side of the key.
So it'd be willing to give it a go.
On what side of the key?
And I've seen the sun's up here.
We should free it.
The key's there.
Yeah.
It's up down that direction.
Same as your wall shadow.
No, that's not the sun.
It appears to be that I'm thinking to keep the same way to pick the new.
Yes.
Plus.
That's an interesting fourth process.
Which brings us back to we need to pick a path.
What happens if we just...
Does the only two going through two paths so far?
That's the only place you can correct.
Let's go that one opposite our shadow.
No.
What happens if we just get a clue?
You can put it over the sunda.
And...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I can't do that.
Sure.
You put a cloak.
Open the sunda.
All right.
There's someone who wants to walk through a place.
Can't let it...
Does anything happen when you do it?
It's not a special scene.
It's not a cloak on the sunda.
No.
I don't know the cloak.
You can still see the shadows.
Interesting.
That did nothing.
That did nothing.
Good.
Just close.
No, we're not there.
Turn down.
I've got my own really long magical shadow and I haven't done something.
You've got three shadows there.
Fuck.
I'm just starting three shadows and you're waiting here.
That's pretty fucking awesome.
And then I cast my image as well.
What's going on?
So the shadows on the sunda...
The shadows on the sunda...
The shadows on the sunda...
The shadows on the sunda...
No.
They made you a pair of...
I'll just start the stroke.
The smile we've followed the shadow.
We followed the shadow this way.
Then we followed the shadow that way.
Now there's three shadows.
And you haven't followed the shadow that way, have you?
No.
We haven't followed the shadow that way either.
Right.
That's the problem.
We would think he was just going to light up the shadow.
We would be.
Absolutely.
Was anyone told anything about this maze before we came in?
No.
You've never got out.
No.
You've got to do a zero information doing.
It's looking that way.
Do we go back in the first moment?
The motion was that keep it in the middle.
There was a apprentice who worked for the do in the tower.
He got booted out.
Just as the guy built his mates, right?
Now, no, he's seen the wizard in the tower sets
and a whole heap of the purple dragon cult have entered
whatever the fuck they are.
Done.
Um, entered.
So I'll be the one to go with that.
No, we can't get that.
And no, he's seen it,
people see random lights on two of the towers,
stuff like that at night and shit.
So they believe there's someone in there.
And we know that my brother and a bunch of dragon culters,
that's happened to the mates.
We have, and we've seen what the towers are.
He's rather standing on the roof,
waiting the dragon mask out.
So I'm gonna say, me, this is the basement.
Yeah.
Basically you're saying, yeah, get to the tower.
Giving is absolutely no fucking information
at a door and then he ran away.
And then he got a dragon cult with chasing him.
So it's so in the middle.
Yeah.
My thought is either follow your own shadow
or go against your own shadow.
Yeah.
Or we go back through the original one you went through.
Mm.
Back to the North again.
Correct.
It's 100%.
There's, who knows what the fucking logic is.
We're trying to work it out, right?
Yeah.
And it's a magical shadow, given the shadow.
So it's irrelevant to potentially where the sun is.
But.
Yep.
My thought of course, is the way to walk towards the tower.
Yeah.
Well, my thought is always walk away from the tower.
So that one thing you could go through.
You could go through that.
Look around his sun bile and see if I can find anything resembling
switches, anything hidden.
Sure.
You know, you've got a sketch and check that.
Sure.
Terrible.
11.
You don't find anything of interest.
Go.
Maybe we got away from the tower.
Directly away from it.
They're just saying, you know, you want to keep people out.
So.
Maybe we'll try that one.
Have those?
Are there any ones that have come out of here?
No.
They have a book in the town with a couple hundred different
adventure parties.
We're here.
No one will ever exhibit the maze.
That's a lot of look.
Yeah.
That's why we've got six healing potions,
the potion of growth, the potion of fire.
I wonder if he's three times plus one dagger,
it's a good flow, doesn't it?
I reckon we'll try that one.
All right.
Sure.
I don't have the suggestion at this stage.
So one to three that one away from the tower.
Away from the tower.
Let's follow the special forces.
Touch.
All right.
You won the three of the tower.
What?
Excellent.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
We can't do it.
All it takes is a tower facing away from the tower.
Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it now.
I'm going to enter the tower.
Yeah.
That's what he said in the text back.
He's, you heard that AI?
Fuck you, AI.
Fuck you, AI.
I'll have to do it.
Yeah.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
You trying to delete it there?
Yeah.
I really don't like drawing tools.
All done.
I'm going to do the drawing.
I mean, you're the one doing the drawing, so it doesn't mean you're the tool.
Yeah.
What the fuck?
No.
No.
No.
Showing us what we can see with the shadows.
It's going every direction.
Yeah.
Sounds like we're probably just re-entered this same room again from any direction.
Just point, bro.
Yeah.
You know what?
Fuck a drawing again.
Can you just put like dots?
Can you just do like a dot?
I just got to keep drawing.
The drawing is like a...
I keep done H's stuff where it's like a fix where you just go like he's a
circle and you just do like a thing thing.
Well, like I said, that's what we've got now.
So you've come back in.
We've re-entered the same room again.
Yeah.
But you've actually come out of the way you came in.
Because now the cars were so far.
I know there's 40.
And that is 40.
So we literally just walked that way.
Came back through that one.
It's mucks and spot-chucks.
Dick.
It's fucking stone, bro.
Yeah.
No.
That's so nice.
What do you...
So the cars are still there.
And we're just...
We should have used all this.
Because I always added a little five spell that's like,
I would have talked to stone work.
And wind out with no use.
So you guys are so fucked.
That would have been amazing.
You guys look back into this place, Ryan,
in this place.
It looks very familiar.
Almost exactly the same as the one you just left.
You can see that the car's still in front of you.
And you can see that there's now shadow.
It's coming from the sundial.
Straight out on the next.
Sort of, yeah.
Which way is the shadow pointing?
Still, all the same directions before.
Some dog.
Can I move anything?
Push it in.
Do anything with it now?
So you're touching the sun dog?
Sure.
Sure.
You like it?
We do.
I try and push it down.
Woo!
I'm going to do some Indiana Jones shit,
where you get back and back of gold.
As you sort of touch it,
all of the shadows start sort of like,
spinning in an antichloc was direction.
The shadow is now like, coming up against the hedges,
and you can see like the shadows moving around and around.
Now, as they're doing in their spinning,
you can see the shadows.
They start up high,
and the shadows are on the hedges.
But it's sort of circle completes the shadow.
Start to come down lower,
and lower, and lower,
and lower.
They're at ground level,
and now the shadows are coming in closer and closer
and eventually they start to hit the sun dog,
and you can see the shadow is going around the sun dog,
starting at the bottom moving their way up.
And eventually they crawl back over the top of the sun
and they meet in this big central point,
and it kind of like has a big bright light.
It disappears.
The sun dog is no.
The sun dog is still there,
and the shadows are gone.
All of the shadows are gone.
Yeah.
Is there a shadow from the sun on the sun dog?
You want to find the reset button?
I think you did.
You're going to look at...
I would never walk towards there.
I'll be like,
I'll be like,
I'll be like,
I'll be like,
I'll be like,
I'll be like,
hmm,
and start wandering down towards the castle.
Okay.
So heading towards the castle.
That's what we did last time.
Yeah.
Heading in that direction.
Yeah.
So heading towards the castle.
Yeah.
You turned it off.
So now you've got to find a way to turn on again.
Well, no.
Yeah.
Well, I'm just...
If that's really set something,
I'll be interested to see if we go back through this.
We follow the same path.
We go the same room.
If you do,
if you do,
what are those five proposals where you have to go like,
certain directions to make sure...
And then push the button?
No, make them all light up at the same fucking time.
That's what I was thinking initially.
And then I went,
our fucking ex-mucksers bought back.
Have we tried like everyone running through a different direction?
At the same time.
Why don't we sketch the castle,
but we don't know.
And well,
you infect it,
like,
or not out of here.
What about that out of here?
So,
all of you are right.
What about you?
I got here.
I went here.
He almost got knocked down.
I did get...
I actually went down.
I went to zero.
I'm sorry,
I wasn't zero at points.
Um,
fucking Jose went to zero at points.
Yeah.
I went,
I was...
You were on my mobile eyes.
Everybody runs through.
One person doesn't come back.
Everybody then runs for the one they went through.
And it's...
Or...
Everybody runs through a piece
and another one of these rooms.
Yeah.
Or a piece in a fucking monster layer,
which is...
Yeah.
It's going to fuck up.
I fell up with a piece in a monster layer.
Josh is looking for something he can't run.
Yeah.
I had a system.
I'm sure he might have it.
No longer have these things.
Just,
just,
just reach the band-aid off
and put a burner bomb up.
I'll give this a second.
Yeah.
Let's fight a burner bomb.
Ah!
That's a matter of it says in the book.
Just give us an walk.
Yeah.
I find it.
All walks in.
I'll give you a big ask.
Yeah.
I think I'll just give you a bullet again.
And I'll try and take some eggs.
I'm in.
One day.
It's going to happen.
Come on, I'm around.
Yeah.
So you're a heading straight through.
So you're a heading straight through.
So you're a heading straight through.
You're a heading straight through.
No, I'm going to take a break.
I'm going to take a break.
Yeah, this road was crap.
Yeah.
It was crap.
Yeah, that was crap.
It was a crap thing.
So we do...
Except we lift them there.
So I'm guessing we walk through there
and did not come back into the same route.
Yeah, the harder someone who is appearing something.
So I didn't want to.
Yes.
I wasn't there for that one.
Yeah.
Well, that's right.
That's why I managed to get the egg in the first place.
You went out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, fucking gay.
What did...
Piece of ghost.
Oh, fucking statue.
What the shit.
What the shit.
I had a pleasant encounter last time.
It was okay.
I think it was very much not ghost.
Oh, no.
Are they statues?
Anyone who takes a close look at the grovelry freak the fuck out.
Oh my god.
It's a nice goon.
It's bad.
Ah.
Shh.
I don't think it.
I walked back through.
I think it's going to give us a picture in a second, probably hopefully.
Yeah.
So walking through to this square, you can see there's six suits of ornate plate males
standing the areas as they form guard.
Batter the bashed pieces of armor and weapons are scattered across the carbon and form
form form.
There's moss and lichen cover the armor.
Though it remains free of rust.
Another pathway opens up in the far side of this area.
So there's six statues or suits of armor standing in the broken bits of armor standing
in the middle of the earth.
And they have a move that I'm doing.
What's this thing in the middle?
Is it like, yeah.
It's like an ornate sort of like guard area.
It's all really a loss.
So that's like manicured grass with a pattern in it.
Yeah, it's got like rusts and lichen growing over it, right?
But it's just sort of like being sort of stone pieces of the...
These are not lichen.
These are not lichen.
Lichen.
Lichen.
Okay.
So it's a red grass.
Okay.
I'm just saying it's a lot of grass pieces.
This is not lichen grass.
That's true.
Well, no, no, we'd get turned into a grass.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
I'm gross.
I'll get you.
You wake up grass.
Don't you worry.
You're the most honest.
Everybody's a drunk.
You're a drunk.
You like to wake up.
Sure.
Let's go down the enemies later.
Sure.
That's a lot of grass.
I lost two grass on them.
Would you like to...
Do we?
Well, you got a raunchy fucking...
Oh, well, I've got a stone.
You got a sword.
You got a raunch.
Who's next?
You got Romain.
I would.
I would.
You're not Romain.
I would.
You're preceding through the roof.
Or are we?
Absolutely.
So you're being the fuck out.
Oh, so you said there's battered and bashed arm-a-line on the ground.
You're on the ground.
You're down.
You're down.
You're down.
You're down.
You're down.
Yeah, like in front of it in the middle of it.
But you're not seeing outside of the red.
Nothing outside of the red.
So that's a combat arena.
What anyone's character is actually recognizing any of these things.
I know that there's a couple of you who have worked up fuck.
But would you actually character as many other fucks that is?
Maybe.
Anyone have any history?
Actually, go to the back.
They're more just like suits and arm-a-line.
Okay.
So red wizards are fade, right?
Yes, Gary.
Yeah, thank you.
So that's not how.
They're not red wizards are fade.
Yeah.
Because if there were six red wizards of fade trapped in this maze.
And we need six snowblobs.
Then fuck!
So what?
Sort of like one one.
Sorry, I was like one.
That's a grass.
I was like overgrown plants and stuff in there as well.
Like that red area.
Uh, so you've got moss and lichen like hub of the armor.
There's no rust, but you're basically talking about the stone slabs making this area, right?
Yeah, you've got the hedges around the side.
You're doing like rolling on the hedges, like, you know, it was like flowers or...
Oh yeah, there's the old black sort of little bit of pink yellow growing on the hedges.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's no arm or anything.
There's no arm outside of the red area though.
There's arm-a-scattered sort of all the way through here.
It's mainly condensed around this area here.
Okay.
Are there any bones in this fucking arm?
Give me a perception check.
Oh yeah, you know that.
Fourteen.
Twenty-nine.
You don't see any indication of your remains or creature lines.
Mmm.
So we're going to try and exit out the opposite end by going behind the statues or...
Oh, I've got two infeasewers.
I don't know that we can.
Ten.
Ten squares.
We can't go behind them.
Can we get round the statues?
You can try.
No, but is it a p yet to be enough space to get round them?
Yeah, you can squeeze so with bit of work, you're not sure if you push one of the statues over.
Are they human size?
Human size.
Can I just try and walk up onto the top of the hedge maze?
With my boots on the rack in there.
Absolutely.
Cool.
So I walk up onto the top of the edge of the pie maze.
What happens?
Is anything weird happen when I get to the top of the maze?
You give me an exterior on.
Next area.
You give me an exterior.
That's a 11 plus 10 free ad five.
25.
25.
So you met the two small people.
You've got 11 on the side.
You've got five for a few.
Five for a few.
So you manage to roll up.
Basically, walk up the sides of this hedge maze, right?
You're standing up on top of it, looking around.
And you can sort of see like, you can see the cast on stuff.
Next thing you know, you're like, you lose your foot even.
You feel like you've been pulled back into the hedge.
You kind of feel like you've just been sucked.
And a bit of a flip into a vortex, and you come back out,
like, next thing you know, you pop out at the bottom of the hedge,
and you're standing next to your maze.
Imagine.
Hey guys.
Interesting.
That was weird.
Are these statues?
Are they holding weaponry?
Yes.
Yeah.
Can I just casually cast this arm on them?
I mean, they have to make a dexterity saving throw.
But if there's a statue, you don't drop the weapon here.
You can try.
Sure.
I'm going to do it on closest one.
I'll let that.
All right.
Open the shoe.
Everybody, just like that.
Everybody.
Okay.
Does it jam it?
It's just something right.
Well technically you can still make your chair.
Yeah.
You're still making the chair up.
It's even still zap.
What is your first step going next to you?
Plus four.
You've lost years.
I did something.
I did something.
I did something.
I did something.
I did something.
Why roll in that 20?
So it's done.
I think it was a plus four.
Wasn't it a plus four?
What is it?
What is it?
We're going to plus four.
That's 34 for next step.
What did you say?
I did to go twice.
I did.
I did.
I did.
I did.
I did.
I did just count it as a 20 and a 12.
What is that?
Seriously, a 30.
Yeah.
A roll in that from 20.
I have plus 10 and I get plus four.
Plus four for a row.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
I'm on it.
What do you call it?
One seven plus seven plus five.
12.
12.
12.
Yeah.
That's just the other ones.
Which ones are we?
That one?
The one in the sword is me.
Is that one in the sword?
Yeah.
That's two of you.
That's two of you.
One of us count?
No.
That one?
That one.
That one.
I did your horse with a survivor before that.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
I would have called it.
That's our son.
One of you.
Oh, okay.
I'd rather one.
17.
All right.
All right.
10.
Sorry.
You rolled this arm.
Yes.
Do you need to do any?
No.
You just said to give me a dexterity saving throw.
Which you've got to go against.
18.
17.
16.
17.
17.
Yeah.
As you do that, like so, you basically, I don't know how it works.
It's like knocks the weapon now.
It's just a magic walk.
It's just a magic walk.
It's just a magic walk.
Yeah, it's just a magic walk.
So yeah, you've basically pulled this weapon out of this guy's hands.
Yeah.
Um, as you, as you've done that, sort of like, he's like, oh shit.
You kind of like stops and turns and looks at you.
But at the same time, so does this guy.
Yeah.
So let's go.
We run back.
We have crystal heads.
We have crystal heads.
Ertz are.
These are actually candles.
They're really cool.
I need them painting.
candles.
They're candles.
candles in their heads.
Yeah.
Oh, they're heads like folded open and a gust of wind.
So candles out.
Didn't disarm the guy.
Oh, yeah.
He's dropped his weapon.
Yeah, he's dropped his weapon.
Okay.
So he's just looking at me.
He's just looking at you.
Just sweet eyes.
Well, red saw.
What are you going to do?
Ah, I can't say another five times on everything here.
Let's go.
There's two of them, right?
There are two of them.
Yeah, we don't have much damage we're going to be able to do that.
Play the candles there.
I've got precision.
Do they actually have candles?
You see that?
You see that just want the candles.
I'll say it again.
I can't do it.
I can't do it like that.
I want to.
They look like suits of armor basically.
So they've just made a suits of armor.
They look like suits of armor that are animating.
Okay.
I'm step up behind.
They're all my cute meatchairs.
I'm just going to shoot him with my number.
27 to hit.
Do it.
Great question.
Patocchio is going to use his elemental things on my weapon.
So it's going to be 10 piercing and 6 acid damage.
And then I'm going to shoot him again for a second time.
Does it appear that that did actual damage to him?
It looks like it's dead to the mouth of it.
Second shot is going to be...
That's a nine plus 12, 21 to hit.
Okay.
And that's another 13 piercing damage.
And then with my bonus action, I'm going to order Tuck here to fly forward.
And he's going to attack as well.
That's a real one.
That's a 10 hit.
It's a big room of him.
You got plenty of luck.
You got options.
Laff.
Laff.
Laff.
Laff.
Laff.
So, I have cast kit.
I'm going to slide over here with no weapon.
Basically right on the corner over here.
So this is...
I think it is wet.
So you're talking a bit.
That's 10 foot.
Yeah.
All right.
So right here on the corner of the square, he's standing in.
Yep.
I cast snap driving on the head behind him.
Okay.
So all flowering plants have been in 20 feet of that point temporarily,
waking down the calm calm, numerous creature that ends its turn within that area.
Must make a deck saving through and take 46 piers on the sail.
That's...
And they also have their movement reduced to 10 feet because the...
Let's say it's a bit pollen.
Everything's sneezing and choking in the area.
It's what's on the sail.
Was that?
Dex there already.
Dex there already.
That's a 16.
Bails.
Fails 46 piers.
Oh, I have 46.
I'll do that.
That's 18.
Five, six, twelve.
Twelve damage.
We've done that.
We've done that.
So it's for a piercing damage.
It's nap drying.
And yeah, that's...
That's that.
That's that.
And does that last from it?
That last for one minute.
Charts.
So yeah, you can move.
Pretty good.
So let's move to the other thing for the most.
Oh wait, is there a thing over there actually?
There's only a tacky sink in target.
No, it tucks everything within 20 feet.
What an exciting hobby is that?
20 feet.
20 feet.
Everything within 20 feet.
I think we don't...
Yep.
11.
So he takes the same.
Yep.
Okay, so they are animated as well.
It's not keen to hit yet.
We're getting these spells from.
They're not really complete type of spells.
Oh, right.
So you don't have it yourself to blame this.
I do have it.
I do have it.
That was a good question.
Hey, it was provided to me.
I use it.
Fuck it.
I can't.
I want to see what that's going to do.
It's like I'm not going to wait.
I will shoot.
I'm not going to watch it.
That's fine.
Okay.
That was a fascinating thing.
Holy fuck.
That's enough.
It's got some amazing stuff.
That's 28.
28.
28.
28.
That'll do.
That'll do it.
That'll do.
That'll do.
That's what my victory is when I came from.
It is.
I reckon most of the spells I have.
That's 20.
21.
21.
Can you see that?
What?
Off with his head.
That one's actually not going to happen.
That was like, that's great.
All right.
He is our sort of like falls to the ground,
clanging in sort of metallic sounds.
And then I will step back.
Ten this one?
Yep.
Yeah.
Dead.
As he falls to the ground though.
Good job.
Fuck me.
Done.
These two.
Turn around and look at you guys.
Do it.
Are they it?
There nobody walk over to the left there by the way.
Because you will get snapped going.
That's what you're looking for.
Basically, if you move anywhere to the left right now,
you're going to hit you.
Roger?
Sorry if you end your turn.
If I end I'm going to end my turn.
And how does the lab communicate this to us?
Hey, Doug?
I think it doesn't.
That's just yours.
Can't you?
I mean, I'm actually seeing the hedges come along.
Seeing the hedge come alive on that side.
That's a huge amount of money.
So I would probably just stay away with it from that natural league.
So, yeah.
Give me a new catch to the next term.
You're just spitting it.
It's snapping.
Yeah.
Yeah.
National fences.
They 10 foot squares?
Yes.
Yeah.
It does not work for a doves plan.
It does not work for my plan.
Don't want to go in the bread zone again.
I would just shoot that one with my cross by then.
Which one?
That one.
You did not.
24.
24.
What a hope.
24 and do it.
It does throw a hole.
I don't think there's anything in the last of me.
It was going to hire the 24.
Nine.
Do you think that?
Yep.
Which one are you shooting?
Yep.
Snap dragon boy.
Your body.
23.
That was good.
10 piece in damage.
He's looking very bad at 25 is the highest.
50 in that and the total ask.
There you go.
Jale Hacks with Kanesia 24.
Yes.
What is your role?
What was your hit before?
Might by like 28 of them.
I just like suggested to you.
Jale Hacks with such a fucking G that in one of the books.
What you thought about it somewhere to negotiate with like this all-powerful.
It's all up in this guy like realm and his car.
Megamaze what happened?
I know.
Jale Hacks on the floor the time.
Do this wall like wasn't going to matter with him.
I was like fuck it.
And he threw a dairy into interest and for this inside the mask.
Works.
It's still playing debt.
It has to be imaginative.
I'm just playing.
I don't really like.
I don't really like.
Do you want to go force?
Do you want me to go like that?
I don't want to go.
Do you want to go over to my favorite dairy?
Or so do you want to go.
I think it's on my.
I think it's on my.
Where it's not.
I'll be.
Yeah.
Jale Hacks with one of those more.
Oh damn.
I actually do.
But the problem with Jale Hacks are when the dark out is as I love the dark out floor.
I love the dark out floor.
I love the fact that they're like a female society that's enslaved the males and fucking
motherfucking idea of the emoji that they have, when they're like coming out of age.
How's it demon shit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've seen the books.
It's all in the books.
They will never represent that again.
They can't just stay in age.
They're all well.
They're well out of the way.
I've seen them too.
Well this is a very fucked basic.
What's the answer it is?
Yeah.
Oh that's the end of my turn.
All right.
Do I risk stepping on the red carpet or not?
You are a strong independent woman.
You would probably also know it's apolyics and kind of combinatoria.
Yeah, which, I mean I have no problem with combinatorics.
Are you going to get stuck in that arena?
It's worth losing.
Yes.
Because this just happened.
I'm just shaking the power.
Let a gem appeared where that super bother was.
Did my power go here?
I was rolling out of that body of armor.
It just happens to be in space around everything in this thing is made with in-changer gems.
10.
So gems.
20.
Yeah.
Does anything happen to Larry steps through the red?
No.
Cool.
So number one, I'm going to cast my special spell things.
I kind of know what the fuck is cool.
I'm going to just like split this arena down the middle.
It looks like a melee over that side range.
Yeah, basically.
I can't remember what's cool.
Not too many fucking things.
What?
Something like that.
It's the plus two AC spell.
I'm going to shoot a face.
Yeah, that one.
Oh, shoot a face.
I re-shield.
Oh.
Yeah.
I re-shield.
Yeah.
I re-shield.
I re-shield my holes.
Yeah.
Doesn't him break it before?
He's well on there.
Yeah.
Cool.
Oh, oh.
Right.
He's on fire.
Oh, no.
Oh, there's a little one spell.
Yeah.
The fuck is going there.
That's the touch that can't look at.
All right.
I don't want to.
What do they mean?
So I'm swinging to hit the, you know, I can't just do that.
There is.
Super Obama.
Yep.
One of these days my pant looks going to catch on fire.
I'm going to run.
That's wrong.
That's wrong.
Oh, I'm just getting a side of the ice, playwrights cards.
Oh.
Was he hit with?
That's all.
Nothing.
Yeah.
You drop your weapon.
It's very dexterity.
You didn't hit anything.
Oh, what do you do?
You dropped your rock.
I dropped my weapon.
I dropped two.
You've dropped your weapon onto yourself.
Therefore, cutting yourself.
You need to take the normal down.
You're going to hit the brush mark.
I'm actually not going to catch that.
I'm not the idea of like when you fuck up so bad like you just hit yourself.
It must have been so hard.
It's like when you can't walk up like a kid and you do that.
Oh, you can't go back with a smoke.
I've cut my own fingers like that.
I also rolled a one for damage.
So, I fell in my weapon and put my shoulder up and then that's probably my turn over.
All right.
Ten.
Ten.
Ten.
Ten.
Ten.
Take damage.
Yeah.
No.
Sorry.
No, I fucked up.
So, it's the end of its turn.
So, the damage already took would be happening now.
Oh, waiting for the one.
You should take the second to find the first.
You can see the same thing that you know.
So, the creature ends its turn.
I mean, that's why I'm just going to die.
And to act, basically, you're meant to get the opportunity to get the other so much.
So, I'm going to get the second to get the second to get the regardless.
Basically, if I can, no, spike growth on crack.
Wow.
What the hell the fuck did that strip?
You get to roll.
Yeah.
That's Aria.
Is it Aria?
Oh, yeah.
I thought you were going to roll.
If you didn't hit roll, you're not going to hit Aria.
No.
And that's my turn.
Hey, wait, did you take you from queer fans or just create?
I just made sure she got pretty self.
That's exactly right.
Oh, I'm so.
Oh, I'm so.
Oh, all right.
All right.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I shot my room into the arm and made it explode.
I'm going to have to spin around to make sure that this guy out the floor.
Actually, no.
I'm going to shoot the fire guy because he's going to spend a couple of turns trying to get to him.
I'm not using the probably the contest to get moved out there.
Oh, I'm going to make up a wall.
That's why we have 14 to hit on the first.
Okay.
I'm not going to do it.
You know, you're not going to do it.
You're not going to do it.
You're not going to do it.
I mean, the fact that I just dropped two twos in a row.
No.
No.
I'm still on the right.
You're not going to wait the time.
I'm going to damage the loop because I'm just going to like,
just going to, just going to, just going to, just going to,
just going to, just going to, just,
he's actually going to flank this guy with area.
Oh, he's going to need to be, to be in good.
It's worth noticing, guys.
Roger, Roger, Roger.
And just look for him to do this.
Just because it's important.
I just got a weapon, as I say.
And he's, he's twice.
Right side is missed twice in a row.
I don't think that's ever happened to be in the history of,
which are at least.
I can't wait to get it done.
I'm going to get something to my eye, guys.
No, they're fucking fucking falling.
I thought I'd just fucking right.
Why did you do it?
I didn't know.
That's an absolute point.
That's an absolute point.
So, you're just, you're just, you're just,
you're just, you're just, you're building up to that.
You're doing a double game.
I'm turning to a double game.
I'm just slapping.
It turns out we were, we were left three episodes, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, I don't know what any of the main play was one of them.
So that's,
which is the power of his range.
Yeah, I like it.
I like it.
Mela, he'd just be a man.
Oh, so, one.
So Max would have done his guitar, get this mic and DC 14,
depth seven through, or look at not bro.
That's not cool.
So we'll take a look at it.
Yeah.
I failed.
You're prone.
You are prone.
And you're surrounded.
Does that mean I get a double game?
You've been there.
You've got me sword and it's now face to face with you.
I could see just from the ground, you know,
like this and stabbing.
I can cast a high shield right.
Oh, good.
Good.
Yeah.
What kind of damage is he doing again?
I just love all the pictures I say of mine.
Like people doing like two double dumb shoes.
So there's a goal.
There's a goal.
No, that'd be 10 pounds too massive damage.
And six as a...
Oh, yeah.
She's looking very battered.
No.
I think it's called a demolisher or something.
What happened?
Yeah.
That's damn good.
Glad to be demolished.
Oh, man.
One of the things that I hate the most of the indie is it's my own time concept.
Tran
That's what I'm saying.
It's just so terrible.
Yeah.
I just do it.
Oh, I can't even buy it anymore anyway.
No, man.
They kick up.
They do well.
But they also die really, really quickly.
Glass can't be on.
So they'll go like quicker or something.
The negative.
Like he never fucking does.
Oh, it will end up becoming a fucking vampire.
Yeah.
But he never died.
Yeah.
I know you're talking about it.
Yeah.
Because you see, yeah.
He's just...
So this guy...
How about he just got a little one of the colleagues that I've had.
He's got a little dog.
Yeah.
But he's holding like a sword.
He's not holding like a sword.
He's not holding like a sword.
He's not the same mechanic.
So he's texting.
He's getting really insane.
He's in trouble.
No.
I saw him.
Cool.
I just do something.
I just do something.
No.
So, so, so, so,
so, one of these guys on the left now have no weapons.
And Kalmo.
Yeah.
Well, they can.
They're just going to get even when they don't.
That's it.
I'm not doing it against.
I'm just standing in the back.
I'm really tempted to hand you my crossbow.
I'm just better.
I'm just better.
I'm just better.
I'm just...
This one he was my boy.
I'm just rubbing it.
Just hand you a crossbow and laugh and run off.
20.
Oh, that's it.
And then critically miss when I'm going.
Yeah.
He's dropping your sword and will he?
Yeah, he's getting done with it.
What's going on?
Tell him anything we're going to do.
Just saving throw.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
21.
That's it's...
Oh, I'm trying to hold his bow.
He's going to hold his bow.
He's going to hold his bow.
He's going to hold his bow.
He's going to hold his bow.
I'm not falling apart.
I'm not going to keep his motherfucker.
The whole bit of a side like Rob's the ground like stops underneath his feet.
Is that a jump forward?
No.
Fuck.
Oh.
Look at the helmet going.
Heh.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's fine.
I don't know what he really said.
He's got some blue for them.
The gems.
Yeah.
And then non-match a clefting encounter.
Right?
So far.
Still a base.
Basically, yeah.
So we killed the first plant and the gem was literally like a pier where it's burnt course
was, right?
Yeah.
But it's just the gem.
Yeah.
Like in the last year of what was a bowl.
So we picked it up.
And then the other plants are like,
oh my god, give that back.
We'll let you through the given back.
Please.
Okay.
Snail, I'll kill the rest.
No gem come out of the one.
Okay.
Not every plant had a gem either.
Yeah, they did.
No, there was 10.
10 or 1, 12 plants.
I thought it was 12 gems.
I thought it was a 1 or 10.
Yeah.
Which term was it?
Which term was it?
I thought it was 12 things.
Uh, Roger.
I know walk over and pick that gem up.
Okay.
That's fine.
Turned off.
I'm actually going to, you, you turn it to a suit of hope.
I am not fighting magical Roger.
What's to say, I'm not already.
I'm not fighting magical Roger.
I'm not fighting magical Roger.
Magic.
Roger.
Um, what's your movement speed, Roger?
Hey, what's your movement speed?
It's only fate at the moment.
I'd fight it.
I'm just going to fight it.
I'll step back out of the right, so just giving with one crossbow bolt.
Yeah.
Um, anything happen when I pick up a gem?
No, no.
Look like a legit gem.
I look like a legit gem.
Let's go.
Yeah.
It looks very expensive.
Oh.
I put it under my foot and it's not on my, okay?
You hurt me for it.
Okay.
Cool.
I put it away and fires across by that.
Just step on the gem.
Five across by.
It's like rolling down, go forward over.
Oh.
20.
In the middle of combat.
Yeah.
I'm going to go one of my attacks, but that shouldn't be good.
Ah, no.
Hang on down.
That's it.
All right.
He falls over and clanks to the ground.
I'm going to go, hey, didn't you have any time to blow to the head?
What are you doing?
Just making sure it's real.
I'm not glass.
Seems like a long time, but whatever.
In the middle of combat.
I already dropped a sword.
Read to me twice.
I got time.
It's all going to help.
It's amazing.
It does.
It just hurts like a bit of an idiot bow.
Like, oh, shit.
Today, he's got no bow string in there.
And the hariser is amazing.
It's amazing.
I didn't throw him that one.
You had a rich one.
That actually happened in one of the drizz books.
These guys are like trying to stalk.
Couldn't the drizz is like hundreds of other fucking
people.
You can't sneak up on me.
The one that's got a lot of drizz.
And he still has parts and cuts the strings of their bodies.
And they're like, what just happened?
He's like, oh, there.
What a badass.
13, again, shooting a drink.
Not interesting to see how the...
Not interesting to see how the...
Not a lot of ice-
Red Sox.
I think it's been two turns.
It's been 12 seconds.
We've got a little while.
Pivot back this way.
So deep breath steady myself.
I'll pat you on the back.
Knock his arrow.
That helped.
26 to hit.
Tuck here is going to give me the...
You take your ass off.
That was great.
Ten, he's seen four ass damage.
One of the guides directly behind Tuck here.
Oh, they're all involved now.
And then I'm going to shoot you.
Oh, yes, they're left now.
That's going to be 27 to hit me some.
One of the grandest alive on...
That's a crime.
Oh, yeah, that one's boring.
That's a crime.
That's going to be another 10 points of piercing damage.
That's a bit of a
It's not going to be the fuck out of them.
They're really easy to kill.
They can't win a still down.
Although they don't win a still down.
You don't know what it is.
Because you're like this.
You're a jerk.
You're a jerk.
That was fun.
Do you want to just make it to the train?
It's not going to be a jerk.
It's not going to be a jerk.
It's not going to be a jerk.
He's like, oh, so he's late.
Who's at the end here?
They've got spears on him.
They've got a cup of coal.
Let's just keep with the fame.
Who's on the end?
You're dead.
This is a hard run.
Turn your end at last.
You're sitting in a piece of dry.
Oh, that's better if he's doing.
No.
He gets excited.
I'm not even going to do that.
Are you using the jars as a kid?
You're a good boss.
No, I'm sure you are.
You should be.
What does this?
I'm keeping in touch.
Do it whenever.
Do they?
Do they?
I'll just put a sample down.
I'm going to need an easy piece.
I'll just put a sample down here.
I'm going to put a sample down here.
I'm going to put a sample down here.
It's not negative.
It's just dying.
Whatever I want.
I'll just put a sample down here.
I'll just put a sample down here.
He's just dying.
No, it's just going to be a little bit of fail.
It's pretty fucking easy for me to fail.
You'll drop your sword.
You'll drop your sword.
You attack no one.
I'm just waiting for them to charge me and hit on me.
I've got to get through everyone else because you're a part of the money.
I should be actually about 20 feet.
The one at the back would just win.
I'll shoot that one because it's stood up or the one that dropped his spear.
I'll drop his spear.
I think the one that stood up between death murder.
I think you're going to have problems.
You've got to hand it.
That's an eye-tying.
That is a hit.
It's like...
Yeah.
That's nice to talk to you.
That's fine.
I'm just throwing it down there.
Any creature that stands up in between talkier and...
I'd lie back down.
I'm not.
You might have been doing it.
11 p.m.
I wouldn't even stand up.
I'd look up a bit.
You just closed the wrong way.
I'm dead.
I've already been doing it again.
It's a bonus action.
I will actually...
I'll move over here to this sort of...
You're getting a snap-drone.
If I end it.
Oh, that's right.
I can't tell you this.
I'll move one back.
I can't even end it.
I've got to see it.
Do you want to see it?
Do you want to see it?
See what they said yellow?
I'm just alive.
It's trying to eat you.
Would you like to go over there?
Basically, it's speeding collars back.
There's a whole lot of information.
These four squares, both rows, is basically no go in terms of...
Unless you want to be spat.
Can I see anything?
I mean, it was in the armor.
Don't keep you.
I've got, oh, I'm magical.
I'm like, I don't imagine.
I don't imagine.
Can I see anything?
I'm not sure if they're just out of magic.
I'm not sure if they're just out of magic.
They just had about about it.
You can't see anything in there.
Apart from what you can see the gems.
Right.
They just had to roll themselves down.
They just had to roll down.
They just had to roll down.
That's cool.
Yeah, that's one.
I probably should face the fucking combat though.
Let's turn it back to it.
You said you'd be back to the snap drag instead.
Yeah, that's fine.
Take a roll.
That's me.
You've got a bedroom take that.
Come on, you want to do...
I know what you want to do.
The double clothes line.
The two at the back.
I can't get that far around.
I think.
I think that would be sick.
No.
If anyone I can gain to hand in,
I just can't run past the past.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Come on.
You got horse, don't you.
You should get that.
I'm just saying if I want to insult a injury,
I can't do it.
If you're stuck in the way,
I can't do it on the next town.
If you're on the right,
I can take it off.
Nice.
The LAR suits are right.
You just see the back of the city bar.
They just take your tail off.
They just take your tail off.
They're like, fuck this.
Yeah, fuck it.
What have we got?
It's 20.
That's that.
That's that.
That's really good guess.
That'll be amazing.
I can't get in that square.
Can I?
No, it's your all minute.
Well, this is a ten foot square.
It's a turkey.
It's a ten foot square.
You can move it right here.
Yeah.
You're feeling there.
Come get that.
I'm talking a bit against the turkey.
It's actually a wicked side.
I can get in there.
Let me hear it.
Let me hear it.
Try nose two.
Oh, you're bashing the one
you've got a band.
They're joining you.
They're bashing the one.
They're bashing the one.
They're bashing the one.
They've got that one.
If they're at kill at this time.
Correct.
We're in advantage.
One of them.
I'm not sure what damage it is.
I'm not sure what damage it is.
Oh, that actually is.
This is great.
It's still a bit of a voice.
It's a voice.
I'm attacking this one, Josh.
Oh, OK.
Are we playing it?
Still.
Oh, that's how we use it.
Oh, I don't know.
I live in.
That will not hit.
Oh, that's it.
Oh, that's it.
Oh, that might hit either.
Oh, fuck.
This squares curse.
Two and three.
Fuck.
I think I actually forgot the dude tech he's attacked.
You did.
Oh, you know what?
Fuck it.
I'm going to use my action search.
Come on, Dave.
I'll have that.
That might hit.
That's will not hit.
That might hit.
That might hit.
Yeah, play that.
Not right.
You said another attack.
No, no.
Oh, yeah.
Actually, it's not haste.
That's the battle hit.
21.
All right.
We'll just pretend that you got a bit of a mic for the guy.
It's boring.
It's very boring.
You're strength safe.
Easy.
16.
You don't want to be doing something.
This doesn't work.
It's a bit of a bit of a mic.
It's a bit of a mic.
It's a bit of a mic.
It's a bit of a mic.
It's a bit of a mic.
This doesn't work out.
It's a bit of a mic.
It's a bit of a mic for the guy.
It's a bit of a mic for the guy.
It's a bit of a mic.
I've said it up.
I know people.
I know people.
I think that's great.
Take seven, four, seven.
Oh, it's a big, big, big, big.
I've got three countertops.
And then, you're very spell and I've not moved to that mic.
You, I mean, you've done.
It's a countertop.
It's a countertop.
Yeah.
10.
15.
It's a little back into the bushes.
It's a little bit of a mic.
I'm not going to move.
I'm not going to move.
I'm not going to move.
I'm going to try and save against this.
I'm going to take that with whoever you get.
Super fucking handy though.
Like, use your volume.
In fact, the Josh has a stock tripping up his wet.
Yeah, it is kind of no.
That's another net to be on Turkey.
Yeah, that's true.
Well, you think about it.
Probably as we realized it was probably about 20 or 20.
What if we thought that that's funny?
But we would be too hand in battle axe.
Yeah.
And he drops that.
Yeah, probably we would be in battle axe.
That's a little bit of a barbarian.
A little general.
And then, a tiny.
And then one of us I use may change legend and just pull his ass out.
What now?
I'm on the fucker.
He's got like a foot stock and it just steps out.
He's been to his stuff in there.
He's got a pit bar barrier in there.
I'm just saying, is that one that he does that right?
Oh!
I'm just saying that like that's the massation.
I do not do bad things with it.
Or it's like, who is this?
That's huge.
No, that's rough.
He's real cool.
Sorry.
He's got the Adam and Tyler as well.
No.
No.
No.
He's got a repost as well.
He's got the fucking caution.
If I was going to play it fine, it's just like a time stop.
That's a blast.
That's it.
Yeah.
He's just got so many maneuvers and play them that you can do.
And when you've got shot by me, it's awesome.
Like we got the snap drill in the gong half and he's pushed
and then he back into it.
Yeah.
So that takes good.
And if there was a pit there, it's on the pit counter.
It is spot.
This is rush down.
It's a force.
It's not a force.
It's a good thing.
Oh, shit.
And then just...
He didn't move.
And then just to finish that shot and Holly would, we've got the wings come out and...
What happened?
Did you end up on the ground there?
Yeah.
Who's there?
Oh, that's the other guy there.
Yeah.
I'd quit.
No, I could go.
I could go.
I could go.
I could go to that suit about.
Yeah.
Because I forgot to do tacky as a tack so I'm going to get a tack.
Now, we can put the tack down the slushing damage.
Oh, okay.
Ten hole points as I think that would be a fight.
Oh, for a crit.
Did you take some down?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, hang on, he's taking the thing down.
Oh, sorry.
Where are you going?
Let's come back and look for it.
Yeah.
They take a load of damage from the plants in his movement there.
We're going to be super pissed when some strategies of brain bookshed by that whole
stuff there.
Oh, and that's exactly what fucking happened in the body in the last in the pool.
Oh, really?
Because the hydrogen wrapped to us.
And we were able to do that.
Yeah, we literally failed our deck's check and we were like, hang in the air.
Yeah, it's bad.
Yeah.
That was the fun thing about hitting Adrian is that he had to sit there actually just
like he couldn't move.
It was good.
Yeah.
That was probably, and literally it was a good thing we had missed.
But we basically can't record it.
Yeah.
I'll take the party down.
I've got to ask them.
That's for there.
Yeah.
Red Sox.
Come on, move.
Don't you?
I haven't had a turn for a whole run.
Sorry.
No, yes.
You want me to go now?
Yeah.
Sure.
Finish it off.
All right.
We're going to hit this one.
There's two guys left.
Yeah.
Well, I'll move into that guy that's over there, right?
You know what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, that's the other weapon.
Roger can look after that guy.
Roger can look after that guy.
Roger can look after that guy.
Roger can look after that guy.
Roger can look after that guy.
That's fun.
Roll away.
Oh no.
I just remember that.
Not sure if I was eight, six, seven.
That one character is being chased by 17.
17.
He's chosen.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Because I stole the fucking relic.
I mean, we realised that that's a huge problem.
That's right.
Because you gave him the gold to take two years.
You can go with the others.
Yeah.
He was like, he flanks to the ground.
No, 20, 60, he hit.
Oh, it's 20, 60.
Yeah, I'm going to say.
Oh.
But, uh, but, uh, but, uh, I'll do a fucking, do a smite because I can, there's been
a while.
Uh, how much the smite act would say he'd hit.
Yeah.
Where he's into the eight.
These are undead, are they?
No, they're magic.
Oh, you're construct.
And magic.
Make a joke because you get an extra day to get an answer there.
Yes.
It's magical.
Yeah.
It's just like, oh, yeah.
They won't get up here.
They won't be full, but they are.
Yeah.
20, 23, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now he's dead.
Oh, he's dead.
You jumped him.
Chunking him.
Well, I know everyone's got good suits about.
Love.
Me?
Yeah.
Longer left.
Me.
Swing him.
He's swinging for a lot of play against.
Yeah.
Just give you the next chair.
Next chair.
I hate that he didn't.
You know what I thought?
He keeps it one of us.
You know what I'm talking about?
He keeps it one of us.
Champs.
That would be great.
Everything would work here.
Um, beyond the two that didn't get to you.
So it's a cantor, doesn't it?
There's no one actually.
There's 48.
No one makes you.
No one makes to already.
I still work out.
I still work out.
I still work out.
I'll do that.
Okay.
You can just imagine a big, most annoying fucking thing in the world if you can't
forget someone that keeps doing the back wall.
Uh, math is hard.
17.
It's not a hit.
18 month.
That's it.
All right.
Roger.
Did you?
I'll move around so that tacky is going on.
I think I've been skipped.
Oh yeah, you're a spin-me.
You got first?
No, you didn't know.
Yeah, you got the old off.
Okay.
I'm backing one person ahead is my problem.
Yeah.
I'm going to hit the start and then I'm clicking it at the end.
20 to hit.
20 to hit.
The hit.
Tuck is going to infuse my strike.
Uh, it's just going to be nine, no, sorry.
12 piercing and three as a damage.
It falls to the ground where the clunk and the clunk.
Okay.
Is there anything cool in the room now?
Right.
No.
That was the yes.
No.
That was.
That was.
That was.
Josh, it turns out I'm like always play with the text at the end.
But now I'm just going to hit.
You're going to push it down on the end.
You got another random as well.
So look around now you can see I was at this chunk of play armor that's scattered across
the area.
There's weapons around on the ground.
One red gem fell out of the first one, which obviously you've picked up.
Apart from that the hit just still alive I'm guessing.
We're a bit more.
Probably like another 30 seconds or something.
Yeah, just pick up all the red.
That's not a concentration or anything.
Not a concentration.
That's it.
I can't dismiss.
All the stuff to start.
I'm going to start rattling.
Got it.
All of the same, like all of the play across the area starting to rattle and wave.
You've seen like hell what's role and weapons thing.
They all start to be bouncing down and taking a gem.
I was going to say I have to imagine to take all the gems out because I did say we're taking a gem.
I'm about to take a gem out of the suit around the bottom of my feet.
And I take my hand off the pipe.
If there's one further away from someone I'll just go magic.
There's one at your feet.
You take that one.
You take those two.
I'll take that one.
And then there's one over there which I'm sure I can grab it.
What a more standard.
Bloodstone gems.
Bloodstone gems.
Bloodstone gems.
All on top of a river bloodstone gem.
Yep.
Yep.
As you do study a GP that wears each.
Oh.
10 million GEP.
It's just for notes.
It's probably quite a fair bit.
Because usually it's like gem 100 GP or something.
I remember it.
I remember it.
I remember it.
I remember it.
I remember it.
This is the problem.
He's got a list.
He's got a list.
We can solve that list.
That's not the idea.
Yeah.
There's it.
Sorry.
It's like a white gem.
It's like a white gem.
Yeah.
I've been still playing with one.
Just the suits of armor stuff while I'm writing when we take the gyps.
Yes.
Yes.
How much do I want?
Please hold.
Oh, she's going to say what it says.
I'm watching a bloodstone gem.
Yeah.
5,000 GP each.
Okay.
I know you're wrong.
I'm just thinking about the old school bonus game.
Pretty sure it was like 60 goldpicks.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Yep.
That might be a little bit red aren't they?
Yeah.
Well, I think they're a little red and black.
100 GP each.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm flushing, man.
There you go.
Now you're shooting.
He's just taking a tipper to the pawn red button.
On gem with God, because the red pawn gem is like a ruby.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think I've got a ruby.
So it's got a ruby, so it'll be armor stuff.
Oh, it's got a nice name.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.
All right.
I'm going to hold my other gems and shit on me from that.
Well, yeah.
This is just what we've played up from this one here.
I guess there's anything else we've been interested in.
I guess we're caught through interesting here.
That's really, I mean, handy.
Certainly will.
Yeah.
Well, I'll inspect this.
I'll measure it in your head.
It's sort of a gesture costume.
You can just, all you really see are signs of like years of fighting.
I don't know how much you can say it.
You can see there is some other armor down there that looks like it's taking a fair beat.
It has an atom atom in again for a bit of time.
Yeah.
But you can't see any remains of anything that will be worn that armor.
Yeah, okay.
There's no other pieces of armor that look remarkably intact for how long that have been out here.
Cool.
So weapons and extraction of special weapons.
I'll smash those to come up with those on two tantrums.
Probably, that would be pretty cool.
I probably knew that three weeks.
I don't know if that was one of those.
I guess we'll go out there.
There's the next one.
Yeah, we'll go up.
Yep.
We're just pretty good.
All right.
You guys leave out through this exit.
Yeah, which entrance do we enter the square room with?
Oh.
You come back.
What's the mouse?
You come back from this direction.
Fuck.
So, okay.
Are there any shadows on the sundar?
Yes.
Where?
This is so much easier.
Oh, okay.
I'll try to tell you.
Is it next again?
It's gone back to an exit.
Okay.
From one trip.
So we have gone to five.
Have you guys tried going through the same one again?
I was going to do that to save that.
Yeah, but we didn't.
You guys hadn't got rid of your shadow and then we went forward.
Yeah.
And then we went back.
Went sideways and then we went forward.
So you're going to go forward towards the tower again.
It's a tower.
It's a tower.
It's working.
You're noticing that as you come back in here, there is obviously the distinctive X shadows
coming out of this thing.
Yeah.
And the walls are.
It swells around again and it sucks into that centre point and then disappears.
Oh, it doesn't stay as a shining thing anymore.
It just disappears.
It's shined but it kind of puffs and disappears.
So the shadow did not go on.
Yes.
But it obviously sent in there on that middle-lum sundar.
Dispreared at that point.
This is when we touched it.
I don't expect the sundar laying in and I pushed the room.
I touched the sundar.
You touched it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We missed it.
We're just, we're just accepting it's because it has been information-sized.
Great.
But, which is normally what happens when we see the other time.
I see the pattern.
I touched the sundar.
So touching it doesn't seem to do anything?
Is the electricity of casting out of healing?
No.
No.
Can you turn it?
Yeah.
You're right up the arse.
It's like you're like, yeah.
Can I turn the sundar?
No.
Can I turn the bit on top of the sundar?
It's like a chunk there but you can't seem to get your fingers on to it to turn it.
Our shadow is still pointing the same direction.
Yes.
Okay.
Well.
So as we walked in and started doing the swirly thing it didn't, it wasn't in like-
A shadow of four shadows and they all sucked in like a go before.
Cool.
Well last time that happened when Ron's touched it.
That's why I touched it and happened when I did my stone.
Do we go directly towards the-
Yeah.
Let's go directly towards the tower this time.
Yep.
We go through there.
I honestly think that those re-
Yeah.
The options and that is towards the tower or away from the tower.
And we just did away from the tower.
I thought we went towards the tower.
No.
No.
We went away from the tower.
Yeah.
Cause the tower is over this side, yeah.
Yeah.
So you've been through that one and you ended up in one of these other ones.
So we're going to go through that one again.
Global.
So, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, that's what we did when we reappear the room.
Then you can back it up.
I don't know if we appear the room again.
As long as we can not show you things,
we're all going to do something.
And then we're reckon we try that one next.
We might just be kind of said we have to go each direction until we defeat everything.
Could be.
It could be that.
All right.
All right.
Could be.
That's right.
And then you're going to have to have a while to wait.
Yeah.
And then you're going to have to wait.
Yeah.
And we're going to have to wait.
Yeah.
So, we're going to have to wait.
So, we're going to have to wait.
So, we're going to have to wait for him.
And he's going to wait until he's waiting.
He's still shooting.
He's like, and he holds off.
Yeah.
Land in the square.
Now, we're going to find the fucking noise.
What did I put in my nose?
Oh, exactly.
So, we're coming to a different room.
Yes!
He's going to do a different room.
Yes.
He's going to change the part because he's a little bitch.
So, we're coming from the disurption.
Yep.
You emerged from the path in an area far larger than any open area you expected to encounter
in the Maids garb.
That's what she said.
It's a rectangular space, it must be 90 feet across with its far wider, almost 150 feet away.
It looks like a bolder, strong caster with a large pond to one side,
an offence vegetable garden and an oversized cottage on the other.
No, oversize cottage.
Yeah.
Sheep graze on the pasture.
What?
Tended by a pair of cyclops.
Aha!
Aha!
A lot of them are moving.
They all appear frozen in time.
Mm.
So, I wonder if...
I wonder if...
I wonder if...
I wonder if by making this shadow we think,
it's been we've done some kind of weird time distortion.
Oh, we shall.
Because, through this maze of any of our long time,
I'm raging this at the end of the year,
is we're a tauci garden in the maze anyway, that's not happening.
And every room is a different fucking weed tauci.
I wish I was doing any of this in Canada.
So they always think so.
One of them is a fucking pair of a look through a weed hose we just want to learn.
I've given them a backstory in my head.
If you see an eyeball, that would want to go.
So, the college is here.
Yeah, that's like that little cottage there.
And they tend to be too shape.
Yeah.
And they're frozen in time.
Yeah.
And not type of the piece of the sheet.
And I'm going to actually have cyclops in a slide.
And the sheet.
And the sheet.
That's a good question.
Have the sheet moving?
Oh, close now.
And the sheet also.
And they're not other sheet, also cyclops.
That's not sheet.
Do they have a dog and a rhino?
It's a bear.
This is one heavy set cyclops.
Can you fucking stand up, Frank?
Needle needs a bit of a bend on the base, bro.
Yeah, that's the fucking, uh, really good.
Yeah, he's got a free cover.
Yeah, he only puts an egg here.
Or he is.
Like a hot.
And I'm going to start going.
But go, go, go.
Bro.
You need to be glued to a base.
So the sheet button over there.
No.
Are they normal colored or are they petrified?
Or is it water moving?
They look normal colored.
So the question is question moving?
No.
The water that ponders a little.
Is there anything to go like if you have a rock and drawing
the water?
You can.
I don't know.
Is there any wind?
There's a ripple.
As you sort of throw it and you throw it and kind of like it
goes up into the air.
And within about a meter, you see.
And I'm saying the water starts to shoot rivers to ripple.
And you can see there's movement in the water as this stone
on the ghost.
You want to go.
Plunk and splashes.
And as you do that, you hear.
Hey, Frederick, watch that one.
It's going to get away.
And these guys will start moving.
Or some of the creatures start moving.
Until they're chasing one of these.
You worked about it.
Okay.
Polymorphic sheet.
Polymorphic sheet.
Everyone held the last.
I'll shake it.
Wolf and chase sheet.
No, no.
So which shape are they trying to chase?
This one down over here.
You're going to.
You're going to cheat.
You're going to have a white.
You're going that way.
All right.
If I catch him, you're cooking dinner.
All right.
I use dash.
I'm going down there.
Okay.
I'm going down there.
That's what they're.
That's what these are tensile.
See, lab just start writing off.
That's where I'm at.
Okay.
Yeah.
Exactly.
They're not going to like you.
I'm tempted to try and pull the, you know, the typical like.
I've got a milk from the giant house.
I've got a milk from the giant house.
I've got a lot of trade.
I've got a hesitate apparently from where he's from.
It's all the rage.
They're they sheets.
I'm all about them.
Maybe I'm ready to let you.
Okay.
Did you know our school taught us how to throw sheet?
It's called throwing them.
So throw it with a turn for flipping them over.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's awesome.
I've not done that.
It would be completely useless in my life.
Sure.
Correct.
You never know when you money to throw a sheet.
That's right.
So you can't have a price to go.
Oh, you sheet.
Yeah.
Nice.
It's a other sheet.
Actual shape.
Yes.
I think it is a sheet.
I think it is a sheet.
I don't know.
Hang on.
You know, bar.
Don't do it.
See that fucking sparkle in your way.
That's it.
That's it.
Oh, not sheet.
Not sheet?
Not sheet.
Not sheet.
Not sheet.
Not sheet.
I know.
I just keep running.
This is going to be best.
That's how it's going to sheet.
All right.
You got that way.
Okay.
That's a sheet.
That's how it's going to be coming.
This one is going to throw down the guts towards the sheet.
That's right.
I'm going to open a bottle of wine.
I just have this week about this hand and a bunch.
I have this week about this hand and a bunch.
I actually have a bunch pulls out.
Oh, here we go.
I've got hair in the room.
Chucks in the palm.
One does over to the palm and throw it up from the hand, really in there.
I just wanna sit down.
And then I just plastered back to your whole watch.
No, I've got the animal influence ring thing.
No.
He tells me.
Why am I chasing this fucking thing?
I mean, I understand why I think...
What are the two hippies? Where are you that fucking animal butt with the horse?
So I've got...
Sit down, I'm a little bit of an animal.
I'm a little bit of an animal.
I'm a snuck.
I'm a snuck.
I'm a snuck.
I'm a animal friendship.
On the sheep.
Fuck is it?
Someone tell me?
Animal friendship.
No.
I'm gonna fish while this happens.
Oh, and that's who we are.
And the attempts that I will have something to contribute to.
Do you convince a beast you make?
No harm.
Choose a beast that you can see within range.
It must be.
I'm assuming the sheep doesn't have intelligence for a while.
No.
No.
If the beast intelligence for a while is the player's own life that these must succeed on a wizard saving through the charmed.
Oh, shit.
The sheep isn't trade on them.
Yeah, this is like sheep rock modity.
So you can... You're gonna charm a sheep.
Yeah.
Alright.
I'm gonna charm the sheep and be like,
hell hell hell how sheep come.
And just like, wait for you.
And so I'll walk up and just like...
The sheep.
The most awkward path you can see.
It must be cyclic.
I'm doing this big fucking eye.
Not sheep.
You could have this.
Not sheep.
Sheep friend.
Not sheep you put all the sheep in the pen.
I don't know.
I don't need you anymore.
Not sheep good.
I don't like his like 10.
He's like, give me the...
What the fuck is going on?
Even tuckies like...
I've got three charges.
I'm assuming that's good day.
I don't know.
So I just do that another two times on the...
As I'm coming past and I get three of them
just casually walk with me back to the pen.
What do you mean you don't need me?
I turn around and say,
It's okay.
Now we're more fair.
Not sheep is good, but I am better.
Not sheep can't throw a bow to look at him.
A peony.
Not sheep.
A peony.
Not sheep.
Come over here.
Not sheep.
So a tie.
I tuck the sheep away.
I'm watching the mat on fishing.
I want to know what the strength is.
Not sheep.
So I tuck the sheep away in the pen and I close the gate.
Yeah.
And then I walk back over.
You're going to have a roll throwing a contest now.
Oh, sorry.
This is a thing I've prepared for.
Laughter.
Not sheep.
Come here.
Yeah.
Hold this right.
Yeah.
Where's the mat when you're in.
Just so you could attack it.
Catch this.
Well, we do have one more sheep.
That could be the target.
Oh, no, sheep.
You're not good at everything.
You're going to throw it his boulder further than us.
Show us that you're good.
To please that further forward into the house.
I'm just actually like these and strength as well.
Thumb his his boulder.
What are we talking about?
It's about two feet.
Oh, it's a pretty fucking big problem.
All right.
The way is about 500 pounds.
Oh, yeah.
Did you say we had a large potion?
I would have a potion of growth, which I think.
Yeah.
You essentially, you know, the large potion.
Not sheep.
Like this.
He picks up this.
I say, you're the first.
You've got a like.
I think it's about to do that.
I summon stealthily using my main chain and legitimate hand behind it.
And as it's about to do it, I like to find his knee.
So he falls backwards with the bottom.
So as he goes back, he will.
He doesn't.
He doesn't.
He doesn't.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
He drops on the other one's foot.
He drops on the other one's foot.
He drops on the other one's foot.
He drops on the bottom.
He drops on the bottom.
What am I going to do?
He's pushing forward.
Maybe.
Maybe not sheep replace you.
You get out of the way.
You know.
You go, Kook dinner.
All right.
I throw it at a rock foot or I'll pick up his rock and he starts standing up.
He's getting ready.
All right.
Oh.
I'll let him throw it.
It flies all the way over.
I see the land that rolls for like another 20 feet.
That's the land right next to everyone.
I'm sitting there fishing.
He has it rolling.
He's going to hand out and stop it.
Oh.
Oh.
Is it fucking strong?
Oh, it's strength of nine to eight.
That's only a little ball run.
All right.
You're going to start to check.
All right.
I'm just trying to work out of any of you.
I'm going to get with each of you.
He keeps conversely.
He can all.
Oh.
I think bear probably be your best bet.
What is the position?
I was actually doing so.
That's a good question.
17.
Josh.
Pretty strong.
Yeah.
What does Grow do?
I shouldn't do.
Makes you a size bigger and give upgrades to start to buy like plus two to one or something.
I don't know.
You probably just put you under the big large bill.
Because if increases my strength, then I'll drink it.
When you drink this potion, you gain the enlarged effect of your large review.
You've got one before an hour.
Oh.
Oh.
I've got a size double.
It's an old dimension.
It's a way to multiply it by eight.
It's going to increase size by one category from medium to large, for example.
If there isn't enough room for the target to double the size of creature.
You'll be bigger than that.
How do we feel about you using that right now?
Well, I think he should probably use it because he's the...
Yeah, but I was seeing him drinking it and using it.
Yeah.
Well, they're going to see you too.
They're distracted by the way.
You're going to say in the...
What's the instrument?
I mean, they're dead.
What is it?
I'm turning into an Albert getting into my...
Is it in the back of the mind?
Do I get it?
What's your instrument?
What's your instrument?
I'm just killing it.
I'm just killing it.
Yeah.
It's like the belly flop of the dirt.
Yeah.
It's higher than yours.
It's higher than mine.
I cut it out.
The tool to...
The tool to...
It's making me go.
The tool to make me go.
The target also has...
I might note that's the creature.
The tool is for those targets.
The tool is to manage on strength checks and strength saving throws.
The target's weapon also grows to matches new size.
Well, these weapons are enlarged.
The target is to attack with them deal one before extra damage.
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
It gives you that.
I'd advise you John Strange.
I think we'll keep it till we need it.
I don't know if you'd be able to deflect this.
I'm not trying to...
Yeah, I'm just trying to stop it.
Because it's a lot of the edge of the motion.
It's too deep to your feet round.
Oh, oh, oh.
This is how I envision it, right?
It's rolling.
It's coming to the end of it.
I need to stop it.
Stop it in the last little bit.
I'm just sitting here.
I'm just catching it.
I'm just not catching it.
I'm not trying to catch it.
He's not trying to deflect it.
He's not trying to deflect it.
He's not trying to deflect it.
Don't be in.
I'm rolling.
Deflect wizards.
Deflect missiles and the sun dragon probably missed.
If it's small enough you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
Yeah, then you can deflect it.
You can deflect it.
Yeah.
It's not my eye.
I'm trying to actually build it.
You can catch it.
This is the time I said come from a fucking game.
I'll give you the, he can do it.
He turned out to be on a huge line.
He could throw ball rat in him that he could catch it.
The way I say it, right, is I'm sitting here fishing.
He's on a roll and it's just coming down.
No, no, no, just put my hand on it as it's stopped right next to me.
Yep.
All right.
I'm not shaking.
Can you do that?
Go down that end.
I want you to throw that ball to hurt me.
If you could throw that ball to me, I'll sell you a better than us.
I'm waiting for nap try.
I'm trying.
So I'll go down there and...
I'm going to throw some of those on there.
I'm going to chip off a bit of the ball.
I'm just going to grab something near by and just like bash off a bit of this boulder.
And then pick that up and launch it back out.
That's the chip.
I'm just going to chip off like whatever.
Like whatever.
Yeah, it could be like a baseball size.
A bit of a boulder comes off.
Yep.
And then it's...
All right.
Throw it back out.
Question.
Yep.
Can we obscure them for a minute?
I was going to say as he throws it, I'll push the boulder into the pond.
So he threw it so hard.
It's like bow top on re-entry.
I wish.
Which is that.
It could be your aces, but we're trying to do some bullshit with it.
It sounds amazing.
But is that one type of it?
I don't know.
I think he's just going to chip a bit off and throw it.
I'm sitting here.
All right.
Look at him and go, hey, hey, bomb them.
I'll launch it.
I'll let you want me to roll for this.
Give me a straight check.
Oh, shit.
Nope.
That's a good point.
See, you throw it like probably 15 feet.
That's a good enough throwing it.
You're going to throw it.
That's a good throw.
That is it.
See?
No, shoot.
Peace week.
And then I just, I'll walk back down when I say,
lab get cheap in pen.
Why throw a bow to re-cheap?
I'm good, ain't.
How about help with cheap?
Do you not trust my aim?
How ain't help with cheap?
You can't even throw it further than the hot.
You can't put cheap in pen?
No, shoot.
You know?
No, no, shoot.
No, let's see.
I'm fucking drowning myself.
What the hell is that?
What are they?
The bowels.
Yeah, I think they're just like rocking little
naps, props and stuff.
How many of these these bowels are on this as gum?
Well, like it's a fun time for your bowels, right?
Like that'll be a fucking heavy, pretty heavy.
Yeah, pretty heavy.
I've had a problem with pounds.
I've had a lot of
I've had a lot of
I've had a lot of
I've had a lot of
a lot of pounds.
I've had a lot of pounds.
I've had a lot of
a lot of pounds.
I've had a lot of pounds.
I've had a lot of pounds.
I've had a lot of pounds.
Yeah, but Courtney could get one of these to help me.
So I just casually say, no, no sheep.
I'm going to turn into a line and start running around.
Joey, can we?
Maybe.
Are you sure?
Maybe.
What a eat sheep.
Maybe we eat not sheep.
I hate that.
I just like basically stop wandering back towards the hot.
I'm not sure who to ride here.
I understand.
I like jump on top of the hot and just
keep like I'm wearing them.
I don't even know if you have to do it alone.
It's like her.
No, she got down.
Her.
Got my car off.
I think that one's actually right.
So they've wandered back this way.
So they've finally seen us now.
I'm going to keep walking this way and then be like, just pass them through.
Come on everyone.
Let's go.
No.
Try it alone.
You take my sheep.
Yeah, well, sheep's a lot.
He pissed week.
Cut through a boulder.
Yeah.
I'm going to put that.
Do I have to do anything?
I'm going to do anything to do with the exit.
Give me a craft to roll.
I don't know.
So my look.
So my will.
Yeah.
That would be the one.
I wonder why the water was rippling before it landed.
It was a major magic.
27.
27.
Yeah.
You catch something.
Yes.
What do I catch?
You catch his boot.
As I walk past it.
And he's a boot.
Did you get that?
In the plant.
I told you I lost my boot.
You.
You do.
You do.
But how do we get to the castle?
I'm going out of way.
Thanks.
Just catch with the no fucking reason.
How do we get to the castle when we get to the sunda thing?
I need to go that away.
All right.
Cool.
Good.
Keep going to shame not to try it.
Shoot milk.
Oh, I see.
I'm getting wet.
I'll go.
Right.
I'll listen to Cam.
You throw a ball roll.
Give me a shoot milk.
I'll go to that.
I'll just try it.
You throw a throw.
You throw a throw.
Oh, I got another in.
You throw a throw.
You throw a throw.
Yeah.
22.
That's pretty good.
That is throwing the actually.
You throw a throw.
He's good now.
You have a five, three, five hundred.
No, he doesn't.
Yeah.
So you pick it up and you throw it like 12 to 10.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not even.
Yeah.
That's pretty heavy.
All of it.
I mean, he still is a lion.
I walk over and like a sniff where my walk is.
I come back over and piss on your walk.
No, sheep.
I pick a wrong.
No, I pick his wrong up and throw it in the pond.
Oh, no.
That was a tight no sheep up.
That was a tight no sheep up.
That was a tight thing.
It's fine.
We sure.
Absolutely.
All right.
All right.
All right.
So it's a 12 down towards it.
So you're walking down this way?
Yep.
Yep.
I followed the directions.
I'm going to fuck me some same line.
You stay in my line?
Yeah.
You got a what?
Hey, I've changed right.
A lot of them trying to do something.
Yeah.
You can last eight hours now.
Right.
So, uh, to the record, to the on spun and stone throw it's held by Swiss company, Marcus
Me and I agree that 83.5 kilograms.
So 4.11 meter.
Yeah.
During the 2004, I'd give no sureston and sweet swing on output of fast.
So the fact that I could even pick it up is a thing that's self.
Well, 400 pounds, I reckon you can pick it up with decent strength.
But it's, you're going to throw it.
No, no.
Well, the fact that, yeah, like the stone throwing thing that they call the competition
they use an 85.5.
Yeah.
So, oh, my pound.
Which is just a ton of 200 kilo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
The hard side of you, like actually getting your grip on to lift it.
You walk out this end of the pitch.
Yeah.
You come back out that end of the hedge.
Good fact sake.
They want us to kill every hat.
No, no.
They're really, they're a cover.
No, shit.
You're back.
You got a fair bolt on the side.
I just won't go without a drink.
I don't know what attack the friend is.
I'm going to pull away.
I'm going to get my peak out and start working on breaking that bolt right off.
Okay.
The logic behind it is they keep asking to throw the bolt up.
Maybe this is game in the bolt.
I was going to say, yeah, looking at the cyclops, do they appear to have any gems on their
person?
No.
Do they have a shape?
No.
The shape look like pretty sad and shape.
Do they have like bells around their neck?
Do they have a gem in them or something?
No.
Do they look like they might have a giant.
I walk over to the pond and look at the pond.
Does it look like there's a fucking gem in the bottom of the fucking pond again?
No.
It doesn't.
I'm happy.
I'm happy.
I'm happy.
We just have five in the house.
Let's try and walk out this way.
Walk out that way.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
We'll go back to the back of the way we came.
Yeah.
The back side.
No.
I need to get a pull straight in there.
No.
No, I need to pull this straight in there.
No, we can.
We'll go back the way we came.
No.
We can't just drop back in the other...
Basically these two entrances in our league.
So there's a puzzle in this room.
See if I can, you know, spot anything out of the ordinary in them.
You stay in no shape.
I just look at them and keep going.
I'll go look after the shape.
It's just very relaxing.
I'm not talking.
I've pushed the rock into the pond.
You've just got to rock into the pond.
Yep.
Great.
Yep.
That's after a rock.
I'm cleaning it.
I know.
Did you into the pond?
Have we ever cleaned this right or not?
So now I don't think we have.
Does it need clay?
Maybe.
Come here, still throw it.
It's like, yeah, I'm sure it's still throw it.
Maybe throw it further.
Exactly.
Can you throw it rock further now that you cleaned it?
Put the fucking bottom down.
It's in the pond now.
Oh, you've got to get it thrown out.
Yeah.
It's got to see in the pond for three weeks.
What we've planned for a rock every day.
How about you dig another one up?
No.
Retards just like standing back and just like...
Why have you tried throwing the rock for the heat in the pond?
Let me kill that.
No.
You know what?
You should try that.
Hey, I don't want to push this back.
I'm going to try it first.
You're going to go in, get it in.
Does he disappear when he gets into the pond?
No.
I guess I like it.
How do you just pull down?
The rock comes up a bit here on him.
OK.
It's his boulder.
I'm going to be like that.
You're like throwing it over his head.
It comes back.
Yeah.
Turn it through up further.
The land's back there.
There's not very far.
Hang on.
Was that the one that tripped and fell up
through up behind him the first time?
Yes.
You did try further.
Ah.
We know it's far like my best record.
No.
But you threw up further than you did last time,
which is what you need to do.
That one doesn't count.
If they left him in the three ways,
it would be super clean.
That's right.
We're trying to hit the head back hedge.
First one hit the back hedge.
That's all.
That's all.
That's cool.
That's all.
What was it?
First to hit the back hedge.
Yeah.
OK.
So I, as a lion, run over in the back hedge.
No sheep.
Do it wrong.
So I can pick this boulder up there.
I pick the boulder up and start walking towards the back hedge.
You got to throw it.
Correct.
I keep walking towards the back hedge.
When I get to the back hedge,
I do this.
And it leaves my head.
I'm throwing it.
And it hits the back hedge.
No.
No.
You said I have to throw it.
And hit the back hedge.
You didn't say where I had to start.
You're a silly little human.
That's not even playing the game.
It is.
I threw it.
He got to throw it from there down the sand.
And it's got to hit down that.
I did.
I picked it up.
No, he did.
I didn't.
I don't know.
I climbed this one.
He's not fun.
He's a treating.
I'm sorry.
What?
He's a chief.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, there we go.
You picked the rock up and you throw it.
We watch it.
And it goes, yep.
I picked the rock up.
And I threw it.
And it hit the back hedge.
Yeah.
But if you start there, and you've got to hit that end.
I did.
And you've started that.
And you've got to hit this end.
I did.
No, you're full of sheep.
You did start couldn't carry it.
You're full of sheep.
You're full of sheep.
I had to throw it from.
You just qualified.
It's fair.
I put the rock back in the pot.
Well, but I roll it from back this other end this time to where it appears to be deeper.
This one's making very rock very hard.
Cleaning it.
But cleaning didn't work.
Because you didn't let it sit long enough.
You've got to have a look around this.
I'll just try to buy these guys some time to do some interesting ways.
Do you enjoy the mountains?
Yeah.
That's true.
I'm starting to get a bit techie from all of them.
So, you can see two large chairs.
Two large beds.
There's a little cooking pot off to the side.
Yep.
And there's a nice cookbook there.
And you can see it's open to this page on how to make a sheep stew.
It involves like putting dandelions and bit of grass in there.
And it looks like a really nasty thing that you would never want to eat.
But the fact that they have some nice, pretty nice.
Pretty impressive.
Okay.
Are there any gems in the heart?
No.
I think we have to move.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come to any other reason.
What are you going to the pond, pick the rock up, go to the thrower.
Can we shoot him in the face?
Okay.
It's a lot of hope.
That is.
I've got a better idea.
Go for it.
Wow.
That's a good idea.
It's a good idea.
Well, the time that you guys come out like they've got this big boulder back out of
the river again.
So I revert back from being a lion.
Yeah.
Because I'm useless.
Like that's why I was a lion.
They can't do anything as a lion.
These guys are like lined up here and they're like,
hey, shall I?
Talking about who can throw a feather.
Cool.
So I go over and I start patting the sheep just like in the fence.
And I'm like, you throw?
I throw.
You got a throw?
You throw.
I throw.
Pick something up because he picks it up and he's about to throw a cast of
some.
And he drops.
He drops.
There's all right.
He skids around.
Oh, I rolled a 20.
He throws that boulder.
Throw the hedge.
It lands.
Throw it out here.
And they're like, yay.
You're rolling through the entrance and he didn't mean the back.
Coming back through his foot.
No, I caught a lot of ants there.
I mean, you can't hit back, hit back.
Can't do that.
No.
Let's go.
Love week.
No sheep, no good.
These guys like they.
No sheep, good with sheep.
What a simple life, fine.
So I rock around, eight, two, six, two, all year long.
What if we throw it together?
Combine your strength.
You can hit the hedge there.
But they're new wing.
You both win.
Is that in the rules?
It's not not in the rules.
They're not confused.
I don't know if you're going to show them.
But we have to murder these guys.
I don't want to be there, guys.
I don't want to be there, guys.
I don't think we're going to do that.
I tell you what.
You both throw it together.
Whoever can run to the boulder, wherever it lands, weeds.
Throw and run.
Yes.
It's in your game.
In your game.
Improved game.
Interesting.
I throw you run.
You both throw.
You both run.
And first one there wins.
Interesting game.
You game.
You game.
You game.
This one picks up his boulder.
You got to throw it together.
Upon the moss.
We'll be done.
We'll be done.
Now we spin together.
What if we like hold hands with a hand?
Are we spin around?
Try it.
I'm just like him moving over here.
I'm just trying to get them both to throw it together.
I'm just trying to go there.
I see a couple options.
I'll see number one options.
We've got to kill them.
We'll just shoot a friend, right?
Well, the other option is to start shooting against the ground.
Yeah, correct.
We need to hit the head to the boulder or maybe push the boulder through the front exit.
Right?
Yeah.
What do you guys want to be?
I'm saying over there with the door.
You stand on your feet.
Yeah.
I'm hiding.
All right, come on.
One, two, make go.
You've run and chased the boulder.
They pick this boulder up.
Mine on either side.
All right.
You got left.
I got right.
They start spinning around this boulder.
And I'm like, but going like a big circle from each other.
Are you ready?
Like, let go.
And then let go.
And then they break your door.
Run.
I start running.
The boulder doesn't really go anywhere.
I'm trying to slip it down.
Okay.
I get halfway and like, you didn't throw it.
We're even forever.
Hold on.
This is not good.
I got that.
You get him silly.
Yeah, that didn't work.
Did it?
Throwing over a funny ear.
I think, I think Charles is going to have a break.
I think, I think.
He's like, I don't know if it or I do.
He's the fuck mother.
I'm going to get, I'm going to get some dog balls
to entertain any more of us.
How are you with riding?
I'm going to do that.
Hey man, what are you asking me?
I want to tie a rope around that boulder.
Yeah, I can do that.
So that I've got a hand to hold on to.
I am not helping this situation.
What?
We are not getting anywhere.
I'll put one.
Let's close.
I need to get some of that ready to.
Wait, you can't throw a boulder?
Well, can't you can't throw a boulder further than me?
No, I can't.
Well, you're weak.
I don't know.
I was going to try and toss a rope around it.
So that's not just skiing.
I walk up to them and I give an arrow right there,
but you can throw this further than you can.
This is not.
Stone doesn't matter.
I can throw a further.
Everybody's in.
I'm not stone.
This is stone.
You've got to throw the rope.
You've got to throw the rope.
Stop changing the rules.
Throw the arrow.
I'm going to shoot you in the fucking fight.
No, it's not.
First, I'm going to throw the rope.
Then I make this both throw the rope.
These guys don't know how to play throw the rope.
All right, how do we throw the rope?
Let me throw a rope again.
You could go.
Throw the rope from this into an end.
All right.
I go off and I pick up my little thing that I had down
on the ground there, but I checked off.
I like to come back and I say,
left rope?
No, I'm not.
Rock.
It's part of it.
Rock, front, rock.
That pebble.
Rock, front, rock.
Yeah, and you broke head off.
It's not okay.
You should have politicized.
I hold the rope and I go, left, sorry.
I'm going to throw the rope.
I'm going to throw the rope.
I'm going to throw the rope.
I'm going to throw the rope.
I'm going to throw the rope.
Should I pull the rope to the big rock?
It's been swung rock dead.
I put the rope into my sling.
Let's start.
I'm like,
ah, get a rope.
I can launch that as far as I can.
This is like,
goes all the way through.
It hits the back edge.
I'm like, yeah, no, you do that.
What is that?
I get my sling on that.
I get my sling on that.
He thought this was...
He's got to be a bit of a sling, is he?
He thought this was...
He's got to throw it in a bit of a sling.
He's got to throw it in a rope without pewdie
sling.
If you gave me that potion,
my weapon grows three.
I'm going to put it in the sling.
He's still not going to drop it.
I'm going to double the size.
I don't think it's going to be quite bad for you.
I don't think I have a catapult in a black hole.
They have a portable hole.
I'm looking at you.
That's what I mean.
I have a portable hole and I didn't think about putting the rock in my hole
and then jiming it out up there.
I'm going to go down and have a look around a pan.
There's anything in the pan.
I park from the sheep to the sheep.
Anyone have a legendary matchup.
Good to have.
Can I have a basket?
A visionary magic.
If only the wizard was here and could cast in large on me.
Or could cast like illusion of a rock.
Or could you push it around the rope or do the roll?
So while they're having like a little whatever is arguing to me,
I just start to roll that boulder out the entrance.
Have that end.
Have that end.
What do you want?
No.
What are you taking?
Rock.
I'm going to point back to the other entrance.
We're going to have to roll the roll.
I just keep rolling.
I picked the rock up.
And I picked the rock up facing that way.
I turn around.
Actually, no.
Yeah.
And just throw it through the entrance.
The rock goes out that end.
That lands at that end.
Have a look at those as well.
He threw rock.
I threw it from where he told me to.
I think he threw rock.
I think he threw it.
I love the effect that we just had to say,
like, dig!
I'm walking over to the cyclops.
And I just slap his hand up off on him.
And he's like, it's done.
As you slap it, you hear it crack.
And the boulder on the other, it splits in half.
Red jim.
I'm out of the boulder.
I'm out of the boulder.
My prize!
Did you know that it was an end of the boulder in the rock
for some time?
I walked over to pick up the jim.
Hey, throw it.
That's his prize.
So, okay, she's in.
We're going to be...
We're going to jim the whole time.
We're going to jim the whole time.
They have two rocks to throw.
They have two rocks.
You can throw it the same time.
Two rock, done his hand.
Do we have to make a new rock?
We have to make new rock now!
Alright, we're leaving.
We want to enjoy making new rock and we walk out the back.
Find our shoes.
We have never moved quicker.
We've just done like a little bit.
Even love is fucking done with it.
You should only get a full length.
10!
Holy shit!
It is four or five, six if you want to.
It was probably pause.
That's something.
just finally fucking escape from dumb and dumb of the sign.
We're back in the main room.
Back in the main room.
Hand me a stat, yeah.
Yeah, there's other.
Oh, and then shout out to us.
And so it was before.
They were before news.
It was before.
How do you consider this fucking thing?
It was 10 feet, 10 feet.
Yeah, that's pretty nice.
Can I climb on top of it?
Yeah.
All right, I climb on top of it.
Just like he did.
Does anything happen?
You disappear.
I do.
Yeah.
Cool.
He's gone, shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So when you say you climb on top of it, I'm assuming you're talking
about the same.
No, you're the sander.
The sander.
The sander.
What?
Is that all we had to do?
What was fucking tough?
Well, I'm not going through another one of those doors.
I'll climb on top of it as well.
We can't.
We can't.
If it's that simple, I'm running his first into that wall.
I'll have a spot right there.
I'm up on top of the sander.
You disappear.
I go after you.
Into the package.
It's not so good.
I can't.
If you take a car's work, okay, person to find out.
That's an all of them disintegration.
Hey, look, if that's the case, I don't care where I have this fucking maze.
That's it.
That's where we're just going.
He's like, I'm not going through another one of those fucking car bills.
And you were eating here last week.
Yep.
I'll try the da.
Yeah.
Fuck it.
Hold them in the nail.
That's great.
I'm up.
Bring it to my one of those as well.
Sweet, sweet, impressive and oblivious.
All right.
We're all climbing.
We're all going down our way to head to Commonwealth.
All right.
So you're all climbing into...
We're trying to.
We're all climbing into...
We're trying to.
We're all climbing into...
We're trying to.
We're going to...
...in the sundial and go somewhere.
I'm so...
I can damn...
I can damn...
Do you need to pee?
Because you can't stand on it.
You're hovering.
There's no way to get my car to fall.
I don't know what it's like.
I don't know what it's like.
I don't know what it's like.
I'm not this time.
The hovering is just for sure.
I don't think there's any excuse none of us.
I didn't think it was going to do anything, but it was mainly to look over the edge.
So...
Okay.
Yeah.
As you guys are sort of like waiting for this to happen.
For hang on.
To...
I don't know.
To...
It's a poor mood.
Yeah.
And we come back in that way.
Come back into the cyclopses.
And what?
No.
You're a big dexterity check.
That's a new rock.
That's not all landed on it.
All the messages, just here.
I don't know.
That's all.
That's all.
That's all.
That's all.
That's all.
That's all.
That's been teleported.
So I have a vantage on dexterity checks due to my boots.
Nice.
That.
That.
Nice.
16.
16.
So...
As you guys like, we're sort of like standing around in the back.
Waiting for this to happen.
I don't know.
You hear a bit of sound.
And you look up and you can see challenges like, oh, okay.
Holy shit.
Falling down.
Straight onto the sun.
Is that before we climb into it?
So you guys are kind of gone through.
You guys are kind of there.
Don't you all like, you're flowing.
You guys are getting ready to get in.
It's falling straight down to you.
So you're clearly falling.
You're clearly falling.
Now you're not flying enough to get out of this somehow.
I can let it down.
Yeah.
So I should just feel like, oh, where's this?
Oh, they hit the chip.
Don't give me an dexterity check.
Don't raise the lane on chance.
How high are we falling from?
About 15 feet.
No, it's out.
No, it's not even with rolling.
Yeah.
On to a fucking like, spaggy zone though.
If you could just blow your levitating, it was a shove so it didn't weigh in.
No, it's not.
Yeah.
I said, when he shoves, like, you could just equal it off to the circle.
Yeah.
All right.
Those are not on top of the sun.
Now, as Dave's falling down, like, helps with the
straight line.
And you're wearing plate too.
That's a disadvantage in my checkbook.
No.
You're wearing basically straight line.
Into your pathway.
Do you do anything with him?
Hold on.
What?
What can I do?
Push me.
Otherwise, catch him like a bridge.
I could push you.
I could push you.
The old guy this way, and you'll go that way.
That kind of works.
Yeah.
That way.
You are wearing a notch face.
If you're surfing, you're an opposite.
I'm really true.
So you're pushing it.
And lap is now falling.
I can't do anything.
That will have an unfortunate one.
Lab, that's your fault.
He's a plant man.
You've noticed that the shadows on the sun die will have changed.
Yeah.
And now they're pointing that way.
Are these motherfuckers on the week?
Yes.
These two?
Yeah.
Oh, I did something.
The shadows are where they're on there.
The takers are there.
Okay.
So the shadows are moving forward now.
So they did do something.
What is forward?
Did they do something?
Well, they haven't.
The x-any of it.
I've got two now.
I'm just close to cleaning the water.
I'm just going to water when we're done here and see what's missing.
What's the information we have?
Because it's absolutely something that we're missing.
There's a line here that says it's like,
and this is not meant to make any sense.
Okay.
What's the matter?
So we just literally have to keep going and killing things and getting gyms
or two.
Probably.
Something happens.
Is there any like?
Well, I'm just taking damage.
I'm just falling.
You guys are like, you're laying this fall.
You're laying it.
Okay.
I mean, I'm having to take the damage if that happens.
Cool.
Is that is an air pointing though?
Is there any like holes, events, anything like that?
Or is it some dot?
No.
No?
Yeah, we do not realize that fall.
So there's numbers can't be there, right?
What's the numbers?
There's numbers can't be there.
There's numbers can't be there.
There's numbers?
No, there's numbers.
There's numbers.
There's numbers of a fact of picture.
It does, yeah.
No, it's not.
It's a song that I don't like.
It's a song that I don't like.
And you tell the fuck the time if there's no numbers.
You die or shit, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, do we?
Is this the first time that they've both been facing that way?
Because we've had the first time correct.
The first time, so the first pass went through there
with that way in that way.
Right.
The second pass was that way in that way.
And then it was that way in that way in that way.
Right.
And then it was the four.
And now it's back to the two.
It was the four for like three times in a row or something.
Yeah.
So we just keep going through that one until shit doesn't change.
Yeah.
We just go through each one sequentially.
I just grab one of the single blocks.
We haven't been through blue.
We haven't been through blue.
Obviously, we have not been through blue at all.
Let's go through blue.
We're going through blue.
Going through blue.
Yeah.
Before we do that, I'm just going to grab one of these stones,
the blood stones are allowed.
Put it on top of the sun dial where like it keeps lighting up
when the shadows are spare.
Is that doing there?
I'm sorry.
It's probably not.
Okay.
Okay.
Sorry.
He's going to put a blood stone on top of the sun dial.
Okay.
Like so you keep trying to set it up.
Yeah.
So it just appear like a light top of the top and the top of the sun.
So you put a blood stone on the sun dial.
It looks like you put a blood stone on the sun dial.
Sweet.
Thanks, mate.
I then touched the sun dial.
Nothing happens.
Does the shadows in?
That's the lead that blood stone there.
We wander off through blue.
Sorry, blue.
Yeah.
I grabbed the stone.
Same as the lead.
I don't know if you don't know.
I'm not leaving a church behind.
What's the food is?
I don't know.
Who left this church behind?
We did not leave treasure.
Take everything.
Leave nothing but footprints.
So you head off along the path.
Yep.
And the curving path you follow is selling.
Twist to reveal like a proper maze cut out of the surrounding hedges.
Moments later the pounding hooves rings out.
And the gorgon charges out of the reider towards him.
Oh, that's not good.
I'm gorgon.
This is a bad time.
Wait.
In this spot?
No.
So we can't go anywhere.
No, we can't go anywhere.
Actually, we can't go anywhere.
So we in the room.
Question is a gorgon that think the church is stone if you look at it.
They can't look at it.
They're random.
They're random.
Yeah.
And it's basically a giant metal ball with a breath weapon attack.
Just a ton of cockpit.
Yes.
Incredibly good time.
How many is this gorgon?
They're larger.
It's a big fucking mechanical ball.
So I'm twice as I hit it.
That was a good one.
That four way yes.
Check that side in the hole.
I'll take this side of the hole.
We just need to get that out of the hole.
And then we just fill it with arrows.
I was more thinking and then we closed the hole.
We should have a flatter.
Like a ron-eyed tourniquil on to somebody.
It's a magical beast.
Oh, that was a giant man.
I'll do it too.
Yeah, not because no.
But then any time we want to get treasure out.
We got most of it out and we were on.
And it's the feather.
There's no feather in the treasure in there.
I think that the hole works is you think what you want.
No, the hole is back.
The hole is back.
The hole is you have to go in there.
It's an extra dimension.
That's a ten foot.
Right.
Ten foot by ten foot.
Ten foot cube.
It's been a long time.
I bring you this tribute.
Wow.
I want to just tell you.
It will be very angry.
It will be the end.
It will be the end.
It will be the end.
It will be the end.
It will go.
Oh, down here.
Your name is Greg.
Okay.
And the gold game's like sitting there like doing a tube of things like kicking back the
dusky.
All right.
It's a bunch of talking.
Let's do a chute.
A chute.
You always do to me?
Are you peaching?
Are you going to pull away?
No.
Why don't we tend to wear this.
The hole as a backup to the peaking.
Yeah.
Fuck it.
Everyone roll.
Let's roll.
Yeah.
Everyone roll initiative.
Wow.
Because to see it's game.
I'll pull your feet.
Thank you.
I just wrote another natural 20.
I don't currently do threading, but I don't feel like it's roll initiative.
I just wrote another natural 20.
You're a bad way.
You don't feel threatened.
Anything in a moment.
So, Aria.
Oh, yeah.
I'm getting to get with the video.
At 27.
Okay.
I got extra for me.
I'm at 24.
I'm at 24.
I'm at 24.
I'm at 24.
And Raji.
23.
What do you want?
I'm at 24.
I'm at 24.
Yeah.
But all my pretty growl does.
I'm Eric Bzz.
Would you funny?
Because that's all I do.
Eric Bzz.
All right.
Ritz that go.
I'm going to do a big middle bolt.
I guess I'm fucking firing out.
It is worth noting that there is a 20.
You can see that way.
We don't want to think chasing us through a maze though.
We don't want to run off.
It wouldn't be very good at cornering.
It wouldn't do a fuck about corners.
It's a giant metal fucking juggle meeting.
You're basically in the same time.
So.
I'm a firing arrow at it.
15 to hit.
15 to hit.
15 will do it.
I'm sure.
I'm not getting easy.
I don't know.
Tuck here will give me the enthusiasm of his acid breath.
That's not a bad deal.
13 magical piercing damage and sick acid damage on the first 10.
What do you want?
I need to do less.
20.
So if I just cast it now, I'm going to jump on the hedge right next to us.
He's going to be very 10 free.
Oh my!
I'm going to take it like 10 seconds.
It's a heavy side.
It's a text check.
No, no, not a good to slot.
It doesn't play anything, but it's like.
It just says I got that move.
That is such a bullshit spell.
It should be reduced.
Oh, there anyway.
Yeah, second fact.
Shouldn't again.
20 to hit.
That's going to be another 13 magical piercing damage.
And then I'm just starting to start moving this way.
Why are you walking around the corner of this too?
I figured I'd like to get some vision for us at least.
So I'm going to step into that square.
See what I can see.
Yeah.
Okay.
We can pry around around the road.
Yeah.
Yes.
Let's go.
You need to cast your spell on it so that it's kind of.
Yeah.
Well, like so.
Yeah.
So all of these.
All right.
Yeah.
I'll just, I'll just, you want to go.
Peking in.
Yeah.
I'll move, move up.
Check that way.
I got 35 feet of movement.
Okay.
Cool.
I'll go back.
I'll go that way.
Five feet.
Yeah.
And that's probably the end of my movement.
Cool.
Don't you?
Oh, that's probably right.
Oh, it's because we're talking about it.
All right.
Let's get a 10-fix quiz.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's, well, I was in the corner of that square.
So, and then Tucky is going to move.
To there.
To there.
Yep.
And tell me what he's dragging.
I can see.
Cool.
Cool.
All right.
And then I shall don't go in the middle part.
It's a dead end.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
So we're actually going to spend our time together.
Okay.
And pull across the portable hole across there.
Yeah.
And then hang like a red cape over there.
Okay.
So this one maybe can't see you guys anymore.
We're looking over the edge of it.
He can see a red.
Yeah.
You can see the red thing.
I've been constantly doing that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Yep.
We'll go straight to Lough.
Pucky going.
Um, means Lough can't see.
No, I won't.
I mean, we won't be able to see the car.
Yeah.
So we're going to go to the side of them.
Hold your hand.
It's a, it's a 10-foot hole.
So it's a circle.
So he will be able to see if he looks over.
Are we sure he'd be able to see it?
Cool.
I want to see how you're up.
That ends up tonight.
I don't want to cast a bit.
So I want to see what the fucking thing is going to say.
Um, yeah.
I'm just going to.
What's up?
Do you want.
I can just do some heat metal on this thing.
It's very made of metal.
It's very made of metal.
It's very made of metal.
That's a black hole.
All right.
So I'm just going to cast heat metal.
Considering how incredibly made of metal it is,
I'm going to cast it at a fourth level.
Oh, it's fucking because.
Um, so what do you know?
He's going to feel like one heat.
I'm going to be like, oh.
Oh, he's going to make it really angry.
I'm just going to.
That's an option, though.
Um, literally it just hits you.
It looks like the only thing that's not my heat metal was designed
so that you will have to.
Yeah.
So you're saying there could change as if you are wanting you to drop something,
but you got nothing to drop.
So you don't need to say just like 48 damage.
Oh, 48.
Um, I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to explode if you put a gorgon in the air.
It's really 20.
20.
20 might be relatively 25 damage.
Oh, DC 10 strength check to force you in hand.
Important.
Oh, I've been close.
Oh.
So you know, I've had extra problems with those belts.
That's what it's supposed to seem.
It's like, I've got to come out there in a way.
I've got to come out in the lights coming on.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I've just read that.
I'm like, I'm pretty sure.
I'm sure.
Gorgon will read that.
18 10.
Yeah.
No, I like it.
It can't destroy it.
But yeah, you're right.
It can easily get out.
Yeah, it wants to.
If it even knows that.
Yeah.
I come down a lot like standing in the roots of these women's
whole
whole lot.
This is the one that's going to do.
Full back in the middle.
It's fold the holes.
Jump it.
You know, I've got a veterinarian around this portable hole
and then we'll like, oh, now.
Chants.
What the fuck?
You've just seen us pull out the portable hole.
Oh, open it up.
I was going to do something, but it's not going to work now.
But, um, he might.
There's not really anything I could do.
These two towering fucking heat shields and they all.
I'll just put you in the stand over here.
I can't believe I'm hit you.
I'll get you behind.
Keep jiggling the fucking beat.
Yeah, what's your most?
You're not helping me out.
I might.
I might just hang it on my shoulder.
He hasn't really had to do anything yet.
He was probably as confused as we were with the fucking cyclops.
He's still confused.
I can't fly over the hedge because he tells me.
He's actually taking side heat damage because he got dumb on the things.
Actually, if that's a thing, I'm seeing what they're doing.
If it goes to shit, I'll come back.
So I'll move to there and have a look.
You won't be able to get to that.
Yeah, they're fordant.
When we start, we'll do it.
I'll move to here then next to him.
He'll move.
He'll just hang in your own too, so he could dash if you throw his action.
I could have dash with my bonus action.
I've got around the corner.
Yeah, it's another golden.
This man says, one of what would happen if we had two organs charge each other.
Two feet.
And two feet of the final.
One of those organs has had heat metal on them.
All right.
I wait till they make contact and then hit them with steam bolt.
Steam bolt with it.
Oh, nice.
He's a public prophet.
Yeah.
And he's already like slash effects and shit about that.
It's already game-bought.
Oh, you motherfucking.
Is he smart enough to that?
Yeah.
It's his base, I would say.
Because all he's doing is the other end.
All right.
Like, you know what to do.
Who's that?
It's a good set.
What's your AC?
Roll it up.
I'll get me.
Yes.
17.
Oh, no.
You're gonna get it.
What the hell are you doing?
You're gonna get it.
What the hell are you doing?
You're gonna get it.
What the hell are you doing?
It's gonna be good.
Click to an audience.
You're shot in a minute.
Twenty six.
I feel it.
Man, I just didn't hit.
So now we're just gonna have to walk over next to Rich's R&B like, all right.
And just walk it over the fucking thing.
Right.
Shh.
I wonder if I keep casting this on this thing.
I wonder if I keep casting this on this thing.
I just lose part.
That's 13% damage.
It's our fault, though.
13% damage.
I'll just walk it off.
Other hole in the balls off.
And you just give me a strength saving throw.
Oh, this will go well.
Am I near area?
Oh, yes.
You're gonna know it's five.
Just...
Plus five.
Yeah.
Plus three.
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, that's three.
Oh, that's two.
That dice is rolled two.
Three times down.
That dice should go well.
Yeah, that's five.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ten, ten.
Ten.
Ten.
You're not prone.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna make it.
Oh, sorry.
That's a bad tool.
A little bit up and go.
Fuck me.
Yeah, I'm getting good.
It's a clear thing with you guys.
That's a 20 hit.
Sorry, come on.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Brett, bro.
I'm getting good.
Oh, God.
Like, that's 15 budgeting damage.
Oh, Trample.
You got trample.
Oh, shit.
I'm fine.
So just run around the corner, not you in the gaps with its score.
Move, and then it's basically trample.
Do you want to use a gun?
And now.
I'm gonna use a lab and a map to its stone.
Can you shut the fuck up?
I'm just going to rinse that ago.
What?
I'm in back to the top.
I'm back to the top.
He doesn't need healthy fuckers.
Cool.
All right.
I mean, sometimes he does.
You want to stand up on your shoes?
It's sometimes sometimes.
You know what?
Sometimes he's probably to rape.
Yes.
I would like to stand up.
As I stand up, I am going to hit the panic button and cast a shirt along the stride on
myself to give myself an extra 20 feet of movement.
And my movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
So fuck you.
I'm out of here.
I was getting decided to hit you.
I know you were there.
Yeah, he's going to fuck out.
So it cost me 15 feet to move at the stand up.
So I've got 20 feet in the extra.
So I've got 20 feet.
I've got 40 feet.
Because I have 35 feet in the high.
So I've got 40 feet of movement.
So I'm just going to go.
Yeah, exactly.
Woo!
Ah, can you also...
You take 1 D65 damage.
You take 4 fired damage.
As my burning strides torch you have around the way.
I'm just trying to like the lutee juice.
Like, boom!
There's a road runner.
There's literally like a trail of fire behind me.
Maybe we should just shuffle all that.
Yeah.
So it's not...
Oh, it's just...
Oh, it's just...
Oh!
How far is it?
That's...
20 feet.
20 feet.
All right.
So from there, I'm going to fire off a couple of arrows.
Not that nice.
That's a standard.
That's a fine.
So, 17 feet.
That's going to hit because of 15 feet before.
How many actions do you get?
What?
The bonus action.
The bonus action.
So it's hard for movement to stand up.
Bonus action to cast a shadow on stride.
Get the fuck out of there.
And now I'm going to shoot you twice with my action.
Okay.
And tucky...
He's always called the most.
He goes, oh, he's got his ass.
Tucky.
And then he's...
And then he's...
Oh, shit!
But it was the first time ever.
He's not magic.
He's rules, bitch.
He's not magic.
He's rules, bitch.
As 13 piercing damage.
You got to remember the range of starfish points.
Yeah.
It's like a cycle man.
That's a cycle man.
I don't know.
I'm going to shoot him again.
Can I have one of those, not firm cuts.
Is it what?
I'm going to be throwing that out.
Is that fail?
Over the bottom.
Oh, yeah.
I think he's doing my finish homework.
He's going to wait.
I bet I'll throw you a piece of cloth on it.
Yeah, but...
It's space inside, so if you pull it down the ground, it's hung inside of the water.
Hmm.
Just don't want it.
This is fucking stupid.
It's a magical bow.
If this attack was made with a bow across by Rolla D8 on a 1-7, the weapons damage is reduced
by 1-4 and 10-4 and 1-8.
The damage is...
I'm going to...
You can't break it into the ground.
Yeah.
That one's not really relevant to a magic bow.
I'll just pull another one.
I bet you...
Do you use Rolla one, do you?
Yeah.
You shoot.
Yeah.
That's why the growth dashes now.
Bang it.
Alright.
What sort of regional are you in at the moment?
I want to do it.
I want to go.
I don't know.
I don't know.
The mistake of conjure is...
It's either that.
No, you want to put it away and beat your nose.
No, no.
It's planes.
I don't think putting it in there should do a whole.
All that's going to do is it'll go in there and we might be able to turn it around.
It'll face it the other way.
It might confuse it.
Oh, you guys can just beat the fuck out of it.
Yeah.
Well, that's the option.
And then I'm going to go...
We'll do another 10, please.
We'll not fuck you can't see me again.
What can I see down there?
Which one was that?
That was that one.
Down there?
Down there?
What?
That was...
That was that one there, Josh.
Rolla one.
In front one.
Oh, and then we'll move.
We'll move.
Tuck your up to a chance.
Is it there for...
Yeah.
I'm going to assume this magic level is waiting for this spell magic.
Okay.
Just on the whole maze.
No.
No.
Like I can magic on the creature.
Yeah, yeah.
You can go up to that.
Well, you have to have to...
Shall we just beat the fuck out of it?
I don't know if that work on a creature.
It does.
Yeah.
It does.
It does.
It does.
It does.
I'm going to jump in front of the board.
I'm going to jump in front.
It depends on what...
Yeah.
I had the creature down.
I'm going to...
I'm on to trust.
I'm going to have this animated object.
So those...
They're a living monstrosity.
Those animated suits of armor.
You probably could have...
Dispelable.
Dispelable.
But this...
This is actually the fact that it is a magical creature.
I'm pretty confident that this is once again a creature with a gem in it.
I would say so.
Yes.
That's fine.
We got this.
So...
There you guys are going to feed the shit out of this thing.
Oh, that's lovely.
Yeah.
I'm going to have to pay.
I'm going to have to pay a lot of fun about shooting the face.
I cast my level once bell once again.
I need your own wonder what...
That one draws handy.
And the ball is about to charge.
Do you want light?
I'm going to give you a second to that.
Yep.
Yep.
Let's go to time.
And you don't have enough air.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Give me a section check.
Oh.
Oh.
What's the perception based on?
Wisdom.
Wisdom.
Wisdom.
Give me a section check and look for bears.
That's like...
What?
Not a fade back.
Three.
So...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Just in the path that it came from.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Who...
Hey.
So it's pretendable.
It's what being projected there.
It's being projected.
Oh, I don't know.
It's being projected.
It didn't manage to be physically damaged.
Yeah.
Fuck me out.
Yeah.
It's magic and damage.
Yeah.
So there is a small glinty mind.
The gall glint is something different.
Yeah.
It's probably the gem showing out it's ass.
It's coming from like behind it.
Behind it.
Like behind it.
Like behind it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The direction it came from.
Okay.
Well, cast doctors.
I don't...
Well, I don't know what that means.
So...
I'm gonna hit it.
Yeah.
It's good.
It's good.
Yeah.
It's fantastic.
I like violence.
Yeah.
You did it.
Oh.
It's a violence community against your table right there.
Yeah.
Just a bit.
So 21.
That hits.
Yep.
And I'm gonna cast a little four smite as well.
Oh.
Why am I shit?
It's good.
Why not.
Oh, that was kind of shit.
Yeah.
I'm gonna cast 25 slashing damage.
And a roll of skin.
And a natural 20.
Oh.
Now I'll cast another level three smite.
Do not shit.
Do not know that.
You're a decomber wallet show.
Okay.
Yeah.
Was that?
My combo wallet show.
Quadriple damage.
Yeah.
And all creases have been your same feet as a target.
I'm so affected.
Pretty good.
Did not know that.
Sorry.
Through is this tank.
It's quadruple damage and all the creases within 15 feet of the target.
It's sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is going to be so good.
He just credit a bond.
Bring the bonds.
I'll be for it.
See what happens.
That's where they'll have to take the old one out.
Ready here.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Chocolate chummet.
You do.
So that's 34.
Yep.
36 damage.
36 damage.
Fuck it out.
Then quadruple damage.
Oh.
Does this thing look like it's actually taken any damage though?
No.
Would we have not noticed?
Well, I just know now after this one down.
But did someone hit it before?
I've been.
Yeah.
Who has been eating now 15 feet?
I'll fuck off.
Well, dribble damage and all creases for 15 feet are all so affected.
We're not creatures.
So when he shot it with two arrows, it didn't get a while checked.
We couldn't.
I wouldn't be awkward.
Fuck.
So when he shot it with two arrows, it looked.
We couldn't tell that it didn't take any damage.
I mean, it got hit, but it didn't look like it was damaged enough to stop it.
This bond that's just gone off effectively, you're certainly concerned that it looks very,
very healthy.
But my sword's physically hit the thing, right?
Oh, yeah.
It's clean.
Okay.
I mean, you did drop his sword last combat.
So...
It's been kind of a missionary damage.
All right.
New plan.
I love this drag.
You go quite sore some light.
So that you're turned on.
Yeah, it is.
It's my turn.
Raji, you're up.
I moved this way as I knew I put my heart put him a hallway.
Yeah.
10, 20.
You accidentally drop it, then.
30 point.
Yeah.
I fought in my heart.
Shit.
I'm gonna be on the subject.
Shit.
I'm gonna be on the subject.
Shit.
I'm gonna be on the subject.
Shit.
Of course I can.
I didn't take it.
I didn't take it.
I was.
Shit.
I'm gonna get my bonus.
I saw it.
You're nothing.
You're nothing.
You see nothing.
Love.
All right.
Sorry.
A few things going on here.
Firstly.
Yeah, that's hot.
That's no one.
Yeah.
I use conjur animal.
No.
So conjure.
Two brown bears.
And I won't shake.
Into brown bear.
So Josh hadn't actually finished.
I'm gonna tunnel move to here.
Okay.
I think I had the card.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to that.
That's all right.
Okay.
There's a dog.
All right.
So love has turned into brown bear.
Yes.
The method role initiative for them will use so many go online with them.
Really?
No, there's that.
Yeah.
I mean, I can't do that.
I can just attack them down there.
I didn't see sheep.
I mean, I can attack because I didn't use them.
Actually, to get them.
Better.
Better time.
Better time.
They have really keen smell.
Okay.
Just letting them.
Okay.
Let's go both of you attack going on.
So I might as well just roll for everything I've got right now.
You've had the only thing I haven't really thought through is how this AI is actually not going to handle like two of them.
Just text.
But actually, you're talking.
And whether it's relevant to the game or not.
The question is though, is it going to split up the thingy with the voices?
There's a 10 here.
One note can do it.
Okay.
Does it 13 here?
I don't think it does.
No.
No.
Okay.
We'll have got a 16 and a 22.
22 hits.
16 hits.
No.
Okay.
Or did last time?
You told me a 15 here.
All right.
I must go that wrong.
All right.
I was surprised I hate because that's essentially a massive platinum gold.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I can four attacks one.
What might have been looking at someone else's last year?
I'm not looking at your ISA.
11 slash eight.
11 slash eight.
11 slash eight.
11 slash eight.
And that is.
He's writing another damage show.
What's really something?
The best.
Just a head of game here.
The bam.
Could be just a head.
Yeah.
Just click on the buttons to make it.
Oh, it's your turn.
He's really typing.
I don't know what the fuck's got on because I couldn't see any of this shit.
No, you do not.
No.
And no one said there's a lot behind it.
Nope.
So all I can hear is a bite going on.
And we actually came running around the corner after on th like it was looking.
Doing your doing his best scorching impression.
Okay.
Just as you all think last month.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see your 10 turns being on the corner.
I'm going to run around the corner on fire.
I'm literally leaving a blazing trail.
And it's probably worth it.
You've never seen him do this before.
I'm just going to shake my head and go.
Okay.
I just literally scored like three times in a row and NBA game.
Fire!
He's on fire!
I'm going to.
Fire.
I'm going to pick around the corner.
And ship marin.
Yep.
You see three bass.
Which is 23.
You see a bear pack.
You've walked that way.
Six seconds like a walk back and gone.
What the fuck?
But the bear's do a peter here.
I'm like, I draw my arrow and I don't like to see the target and I see the bear's.
I'm like, he's loud probably.
My arrow goes.
Which one is less?
Me.
It's not that.
Sorry, Spock.
What's worse than funny?
If funny, I go again and through.
I think.
I think there's a damage.
Not nice.
That's a crazy damage.
And then I will step back to where I'm going to get one bow attack.
Yeah, because it's a road.
Yeah, it's a road.
Yeah, it's a road attack.
Yeah.
It does more damage than it's to attack.
Yeah.
All right.
This is the.
Yeah.
Googon 10.
Googon have to.
Googon brief.
That's sort of green nasty shit in a cone.
Uh oh.
A distraction.
Which direction?
Straight in the direction he's facing.
Two bears.
Two bears in a paladin.
Two bears in a paladin.
Two bears in a paladin.
One of these.
Yeah.
He's going to be missing the paladin or missing the bear.
It's coming.
He's going to be a constitution saving through.
Last five.
Maybe a good one boys.
What's my call?
I don't know.
What's the bear's calling?
New characters in a team.
Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe that.
It's a bear's calling.
I can't believe that.
It's a bear's calling.
I can't believe that.
I'm going to call him.
I'm going to call him.
I'm going to call him.
I'm going to call him.
I'm going to call him.
Oh, I'm going to call him.
Uh, 21.
Oh, what's your ask up?
Uh, so I rolled.
Big.
Uh, yeah, so I rolled 26.
They rolled a big big.
Big.
You both rolled really good.
Um, thank you.
What about the other bear?
I'm just asking.
What do you actually hit the other bear?
Because the other bear's the side of it to coin.
It's going like that.
Right?
It's not going.
Yeah.
This place now.
Okay.
You are good.
You passed that flying call.
It's only happy to roll for it, but I just don't get to do it.
Yeah.
All right.
Not even.
All right.
Noting that I haven't been chasing by the organ.
Yeah.
I'll be like, what the hell?
What happened?
What happened?
Good?
I like.
Hey, go.
You just quit.
You just quit.
You're just doing bad.
You're just doing bad.
You're like, we've both done that.
You're really fucking right.
Yeah.
That is a natural 20.
Whoa.
Fuck that natural 20.
You're leaving coming.
You're leaving coming.
Let me get a small one.
Let me get a small one.
Let me get a small one.
Let me get a small one.
Let me get a small one.
All of them.
Pin quadruple damage in the target is pinned to the ground.
It becomes restrained.
Fuck you.
You're going.
All right.
And now we can step forward.
No, we can step back.
Whatever.
It's going to be.
It's going to be.
It's going to be.
Wow.
It's at 7.
14.
I'll quit.
I'll quit that.
And this is 17.
17.
22 plus six is 28 points of piercing damage.
Do I realize that by our result, do we need damage to this thing when I shoot it down?
Yeah.
Cool.
And then I'm just going to sprint around this corner.
So that's 10, 20.
I noticed it.
I should do any damage.
You're noticing that you're hitting metal.
And like, sure, you're impacting against it.
But you don't seem to be penetrating it.
40 more of that.
Where'd you end up?
Yeah.
50.
Actually, we'll call that 45.
50.
Do I see this part going light with my 25 passive perception?
Give me a perception show.
He's got a pass for his perception.
That's fine.
That's fine.
I want you to roll that one.
20-six.
Yeah.
You can see a gap.
A gap appears to be a gem like a whiteish gem.
Some of you suspect it's going to be a diamond line in the dust behind where the
gold is going to be.
I thought it was projected.
You're going to get a figure in the hole that the pool would disappear.
So pretty much where I was going.
So far, I'm standing.
I know.
I'm not going to do that.
I'm actually looking at that.
Yeah, back in here.
Like in the pathway I came from.
Where I'm about to be standing.
Yeah.
Where I'm about to be standing.
Yeah.
Cool.
Cool.
All right.
I didn't get a diamond.
Cool.
Can I get a diamond?
Cool.
Can I get a diamond?
Cool.
That's me, that's me.
I'm going to go into a tab and then just put on this table.
All right.
You're going.
All right.
Knowing what we know, though, could we just walk around the corner and go and follow us?
I've got a feeling you would have chased us through the hole, man.
Yeah.
Don't forget, this thing has done damage to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not taking damage.
No, I'm going to do that.
It's just ironing.
Yeah.
I don't know.
There's no point in getting it.
You could call out, whether Jimmy.
Yeah.
You're not where your shiny thing is.
Hey, Roger.
There's something shining behind the bear.
Remember those people's end of the fucking...
It's a diamond.
I can see it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I watched one figure up.
You can see it from the strongest back here.
Who's talking?
No.
You stay quiet.
I see.
I see.
Yeah.
The first one.
Leave it for the first time.
Even he's 1,000 foot.
Something.
But it won't even be close there.
Well, there he went.
It wastered, I couldn't even wait.
ITry things from the other side.
I wear this in my fridge.
Okay.
Yeah.
to make that off.
But behind you you can actually be a full-inch.
Is that still going on a college?
And then I kind of like tackles up.
Yeah.
You're not behind you.
It's not going to be a whole country.
And then you're like, you're a full-
you're a full-inch.
And then you're trying to figure out a repair the rock.
I've introduced another map.
Yeah.
I've got a zero.
So the, the, the, the hatch request.
I've got a whole new, there's another hole in the hedge point.
And you can see a pathway.
Beyond that chart, too, I do.
That's, you can see it's not.
It was, it's their attempt at opening your head.
Yeah.
Um, okay.
You doesn't work at the start of what?
Um, I am.
I am the hardcore player.
You've also heard Rick rolling everyone.
Yeah.
You've heard the sound of foliage like moving and rustling.
And you can understand.
Now the real goal can come to our, you, you don't have any visual sense of what's happening,
but you can hear something rustling.
Question.
You know what happened to the diamond up?
What happens with the golden?
The golden's still there.
There's a, now appeared to have taken a shit ton of damage?
No.
Does it disappear when I put the hang on?
Is this an actual diamond?
Good question.
Would you like to take a torch off and get a chassis?
No.
No.
Actually, yes.
Cause that was being around his face.
I actually did what I did last time.
I'm not going to step on it this time.
I like, get the bottom of my,
so it hits really fucking hard and it doesn't seem to.
Yep.
You're good.
Which has just been,
why do you keep hitting gems?
So no kink, I guess.
So Roger, you've picked it up.
Anybody else?
You put it in the pot of a hole.
Yep.
Anybody else?
I don't think I can quite get to that golden.
Oh, I think you're a golden.
Yeah, as you step out there,
you can see down the side,
there's now a new puff.
Oh, as I can see down here.
Yeah.
There's a puff in here that you can see that it's different.
What do you mean is different?
There's a hole open in the hedge.
It's like a whole puff way through the hedge that you do see before.
I would go take that hole out, but I really should help Aria.
10, 20.
Crossbow time.
No.
Get me.
10, 20, 20.
10, 20.
10, 20.
You're just secret attack.
You do have access to the butthole.
Keep me in mind, the gorgons actually knocked over at my mensina.
It's just kicking into the ground plant arrow.
Oh, so you've got...
But there was no saving throw.
It's just fucking restrained.
Yes.
Those cards are like bullshit.
So you've got a...
You've got a advantage.
You've got a advantage.
You've got a advantage.
No way for him to become unrisk...
Actually, we can just walk away from this fucking thing.
It's restraint.
You can't fucking move.
I just want to say that you're saving throw against it being restrained.
According to the card.
I want to say that it takes damage because obviously...
However, we are in a really good position to barrel...
Oh, crap.
I'm ready.
I'm going to pass a prize.
No one's redoing my head.
It's just expensive dice, man.
I'm going to pass it.
My metal one's in the bag too much empty.
I'm going to throw a shunt of hurt you.
Actually, there you have it.
Now fucking shunt.
Oh, I don't know how this is going to work.
Actually, yes I do.
I'll have a suggestion and I'll have a suggestion.
My son damage, you and the target may have made contested strength checks.
If the target loses, then weapon is broken.
If someone loses because it's restrained.
I vote that it's horn to get smashed off.
I just sever it's horns.
So as you kind of do that, you smash throw and it doesn't matter how hard you hit it.
You notice that you are not smashing through these horns.
That's clanging back.
Does it take no damage?
Does it take any damage?
Even with my magical weapon?
Even with your magical weapon.
Interesting.
I see you later!
I'm going to get back to there.
So now I'll take my held action.
There's that one.
I'm going to get hold.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to run around and investigate this russlet.
Do you see a pathway in there?
And beyond the pathway, you can see the sun off.
Son of a bitch!
Can you see the back of the chance of head through the mud pathway?
Yes!
Yes, you can see chance.
He's on the other way, on the other side.
There's one open up behind chance over there as well.
So you can see the sun down and you can see chance.
Yeah.
I look at him.
You're straight through.
You're looking straight through.
It is...
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
So maybe when we get back we don't go straight through.
And we take one at here.
Have we...
I don't think we're going to aim the dangle pathway.
One day we just got a dangle.
Okay, dangle suck.
Let's stick to the cuddle direction.
Oh, I guess it's who's next.
Everybody flee the maze.
May.
Is it me?
Love.
Love things.
Love run.
I don't know, do we want to look to the rest of the maze?
They want to sit down and look in here.
I'll take care.
I'll take care.
I'll take care.
I'll take care of the
I'll take care of the
I'll take care of the maze.
Do you want to have a little rest on it?
You kind of want me to sort it right now.
Can you drink it?
Can you drink it?
Does it double your spring distance as well?
No, it just gives me 20 extra feet of movement.
So at the moment I've got 55 feet of movement.
But I mean it's 110.
The movement is clear.
Yes, yes.
I'm going to squeeze the squats.
I've told you what is my own shit button.
If it comes near me it's going to take one D6 fight and in the event that there is another exit.
Yes.
Does it matter like we've finished my own shit?
Yes, because there's another exit.
It's going to go back to the same spot.
Not necessarily.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
It could be one that needs to do something.
Two hundred hours.
No, no.
Well, I'm just going to because he's pinned to kind of do shit together.
Like quite a move.
Sorry.
I mean, rules are written.
I'm just already looking out.
No, no.
I can see the straight apart.
I can see the back of your head.
So I'm sort of like glow out.
It's right here.
I was going to go in my last one.
That's weird.
Wait, so you're not behind me.
No, I've been doing it here.
You're the whole that edge.
You're right here.
You're headed over in the past.
So we can say the sundial and then pass the sundial.
He can see the back of your head.
So I said when we get back, we're not going to ugly.
Oh, fuck it.
I'm just going to step to there.
I haven't both of those as well with my last 10.
Jesus.
We're just now making sure there's no other English.
And I just yelled, tied to the base people.
And just got the shit from behind you.
Just for the shit.
I'm going to attack the organ in the middle.
I'm going to blow through my arms and down.
What?
What?
What?
17?
17?
I was not a hit.
15, so I'm here.
That's not a hit.
19.
That is a hit.
One hit.
6th of a trip.
You do zero damage.
6 damage.
There's a barrier in there.
I'm getting out of the maze.
I said chance starts walking towards you.
Yeah.
As you turn around, you can see Ari at the other side of the sundial.
You're fresh.
You said chance is gone.
Chances go.
Chances wrap up.
He's out of here.
He's out of the organ's turn.
Googen basically like he just like spends his turn as like standing up.
He breaks out of this fun thing.
Okay.
He turns around and basically scores one of these best.
Oh!
I got to talk to late.
So.
Did you do it?
I can talk to you.
I can talk to you.
I can talk to you.
That's a 14.
I got to talk to look around.
14?
No.
You chose to look around.
I think we should look around.
Yeah.
That's me getting told.
He's a, he's Brad Bazzle.
Josh, you're a Brad Bazzle.
Sorry, Brad Bazzle.
Brad Bazzle.
Uh, I'll do that.
I'm pretty sure it is.
I'm a better one, I say.
Never nice.
Oh, wait.
That's right.
Yeah.
You don't join.
Brad Bazzle.
Yeah.
Bop Bazzle.
Bop Bazzle.
Bop Bazzle.
Are you a Bop Bazzle?
Yes.
That's a 27.
Yeah.
No, that's the damage.
Okay.
Is it very big?
Oh, cool.
The best thing is on phonies.
It's got a bit of health.
It does have a bit of health.
So fuck you.
Very protective of these mares.
I'm just angry that we didn't do any damage to the fucking thing.
Great sound.
We're probably pumped for like 120 damage.
He did.
I did that.
He did quite a hit.
It's been like 250.
You're like, what?
10, 20.
You're on his own.
Yeah, it's a bit of a bit of a hit.
It's just looking for treasure.
I'm looking for treasure.
There's 25.
Oh, yeah.
Are you going to come back that way?
35.
45.
Oh, wait.
Oh, it's right.
It's not a fucking pen there.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, it's a 45 to there.
You can see a hole through there.
That's kind of late.
You can see that.
Yeah.
That's a 45 to there.
You can see a hole through there.
That's kind of late.
You can probably see changes through that hole.
Go through there and see if you can see chance in the in the map.
So that's 55.
What can I see through the hole?
You can see chance mast away.
On top of that.
Wow.
Clearly not me.
I'd be too still.
You can't hug this actually.
But I'm like, you see, you say no, this is not like your best of me.
You're like, oh no.
There's something you should know it want to see.
All right.
I'm just standing there and there's a mate changing from the people.
I can't see the bait.
You can't see any of the head to a z.
I do have the arms to make it.
I do have my clams.
Then I'm going to dance.
I'm going to dance right.
It's right.
I'm going to make it any colder.
I'm already moving.
110 feet.
Oh, 50 feet.
55.
What do I see?
Oh, don't do.
No.
Well, this may be something.
I reckon there's another one over there.
Yeah.
One of each of the questions.
The question is when he saw chance, standing near the sunda, just a little bit.
Could you see?
Why not?
Yeah.
Straight ahead.
Yeah.
Because the Irish straight ahead.
Where would you guys position?
So chance will be the sunda.
No, no, that's side, right?
Yeah, the angle.
Could.
Yeah, you can see both of them.
So you look past, he could see past chance.
Yeah, straight to pass chances in the center.
Okay.
Fucking thing.
You kind of look like you're standing behind the chance.
Like you're all behind the one that chance just came out of.
Fuck me.
It makes all of Max's no sense.
Yeah.
I think it's true that we're trying to avoid the shittness.
And it's not it's go through doors, collect gems, and then it probably unlocks the way.
Yeah.
But basically we need to account everyone that we've gone through and go through ones that we haven't gone through.
I think.
Yeah.
That's what we're thinking.
Well, no, because we've gone through it, we've doubled up, Scott.
Because you guys went through that up-line and we went through that up-line and you've got two different outcomes.
So maybe there's no...
Because you went that way first, he knew towards the castle.
Yeah.
Well, we went through there again.
And went through the side-cut when there wasn't a point there.
If we were to climb up on top of the sunda,
that was where we went opposite.
No, we've seen the father's rise.
Opposite was the only one who just continued to fall.
Would we eventually hit total velocity?
Maybe.
Which zone is it?
Yes.
You can try.
You can try.
You can do the pros.
Just saying.
I think you can go faster after break the sand barrier.
I reckon.
And like, first then we went through the magic of this maze.
You gone through it?
Yeah.
I mean, you've got to be stuck on me.
No, I'm not doing it.
So I guess we like playing for all of our game.
Rudge.
Oh, let's just say that Taki,
I just went here for this.
Yeah, he's out.
He's chilling with chance.
He's talking about it.
Do you understand the coin?
Yeah.
I hear as I walk out.
Yeah, can we just explore?
Let's just go.
Let's just go.
I can't remember what language is on this thing.
It's been common at Aqui in the one other one.
I'm not going to go.
10, 20.
There you go there.
Go there.
Well, no, I had to go there.
Of course I have the one.
30, 40, 50, or 50, or you can get here.
Is there one there?
There's one there as well.
60.
That's right.
Oh, no, sorry.
I think so.
That's everything.
Yep.
So go out that way.
Hey guys, is that everything?
Yeah.
You're not sure.
Yeah.
You're not going to be some CSL standing around a sun dot.
I'm like, motherfuckers, that's when you talk.
You're talking.
You're a whole year.
You're a whole rocker rocker rocker rocker.
You're a man.
You're a man.
You're a man.
You're a rock.
I'm still using the language that is on my hand.
You're a jerk.
You're a jerk.
You're a jerk.
You're just going to make the go and chase me too much.
Don't want to end it.
Oh, it's all going to do it.
Oh, it's all going to do it.
The googings going to attack the mess.
That's why I work with those.
There's the.
It's a very big buzz eight.
Everything's going to be too.
That is.
That's mine.
You can see.
12.
So we can find 17 points.
17 points.
I'm a giant.
A giant diamond.
It's just.
And waste.
It's supposed to go.
I guess the thing is you're supposed to go, oh, a gorgon and run away from it.
And then the bit's not quite it.
Like go back and go, oh, there's a deer.
Pick it up and then the doors open.
Lose it in the ways and then find it.
Yeah.
Well, we lost it in the most.
We lost it in the most.
That's for sure.
Oh, all right.
All right.
What shadow is it we got?
And before I get back to the group, I turn off a shadow on stripes.
I don't burn in your very considerate.
So thank you.
Look, I'm a.
What can I say?
I'm a team player.
I'm going to just ask the question.
But I don't know anyone asked the question.
Like if we look down each hallway, what can we say?
Can you tell me which one I see something different?
You can see my is called.
You can see my is called.
Yeah.
So that's the same configuration as what we just had.
Yep.
No, blue ones.
Hey, who's he's pushing?
Who?
Who?
Who's a line?
The shake it.
Yeah.
And a giant fucking scar from one of the top of his shoulder
down the side of his.
Come on, Isaiah.
What's going on?
How's this posted a photo?
You're alive.
Thank fuck.
Stables.
Fuckin Jesus.
That's what I'm saying.
Sounds something's but there is.
I like it.
Holy shit.
Fuckin.
Oh, what a fucking badass.
That is fucking nuts, mate.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
You only take a half of his hair though.
Yeah, that just got a fucking like side fucking shagged off what they needed.
I'm just like fucking ragdoll now.
Yeah.
Burousing's interesting.
Yeah.
Burousing can be fucked for a while.
Yeah.
Fuck me.
That's a big, big fucking thing.
Yeah, they cut his head open man and they had a fucking like, you got to remember they've
got to peel the skin all the way back so they can cut the, the amount you got to remove the
skull.
The skull skull.
Remember they cut a piece of the skull out and then stick, why is soldering wires inside of
fucking veins?
He just brained a burn.
There's a whole part where it just been stretched over his eye pretty much.
Yeah.
Look at the bruising ones.
Yeah.
That's interesting like where it's coming out.
Who could look at a lot of fucking worse than that, so.
Yeah.
Could look at a lot worse than that.
Oh, 100%.
Yeah.
Fuck you.
Well, he's not dead.
That's fucking good.
Yeah.
It's very good.
I mean, why are you when he got to six days?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna lie.
You'd actually hit up my boss this morning and be like, hey, can you just let me know if
you can see his name comes from?
Yeah.
I'm just gonna hit up my sister-in-law.
She works up and flint as I was like, can you just check for me?
That's good.
It's good.
It's good.
So I'm back in the room.
Back in the room and the shadows are pointing to the same fucking direction.
Can we see?
Oh, we can see.
Which part is happening we go on now?
We haven't gone.
We haven't gone yet.
We haven't gone yet.
We haven't gone yet.
We haven't gone yet.
Let's kill each other.
Did you guys want to call it before we do another?
It's time.
Michael, you fucking encounter?
I had a black one.
No, I probably should have this first.
Because we're gonna end up in another five.
He's going to see if we need to pick up his still fucking line.
What do you guys got through one more?
The Josh is ob
this.
We still have it.
We still have it.
Where are we?
We're starting.
We're starting.
We're starting.
I don't have any more prep.
I'm already prep.
We're already in.
You're welcome.
We haven't gone yet.
I'm just going to see what I've calculated this.
There is two more sessions.
Josh, we're going through that one.
Just to see what we've got.
Josh, you're going through that one just to see what's there.
All right.
Give us the rundown.
That way we can at least end in a different room.
Maybe.
And here we're like, yeah, nothing.
Except, except for your walk back.
Yeah, those weeks we're just going to pee back in this room.
No, there's two shadows.
No, no, there's no shadows down that one.
Right.
So therefore that room is not unlocked.
I'm going to totally once we've done all this.
Read, being counter.
Yes, I want that one.
What's it for?
See, you block it.
Who's a fucker, wrote this and then someone strongly would.
And then you can't.
No.
Right.
Is it the fuck you're going to write this campaign?
I don't know the answer.
All right.
This one's funny because it's one of the first ones they made.
Right.
And it's no one to be one of the worst campaigns I've ever read.
Okay.
So why am I in this much better than Strauss?
Still.
It's just a piece.
This kind of reminds me of a bit more of a princess of a hockalips, which kind of had like more
dungeons.
That's a randomness to it.
I still have the first ones written.
I didn't do justice in Australia.
I look back about that justice at all.
And also like going into Strad thinking and being back to the end.
And that's exactly what killed it for.
I went to the effort of writing a backstory.
Yeah.
And if you play Strad you've got to make sure you play as a fronper over here.
Or you don't have to.
Or just know that your backstory if it's outside of like, you know, maybe somebody went missing
in Baro
in that toy.
So they give you a little bit of a hook inside Barovia to go up.
You've got to know what you're going.
You've got to know what you're going.
You're going, we're going to Strad.
Cool.
All right.
Cool.
It's in the forgot realms.
I'm going to make most back to you.
I forgot realms.
You're going to start the whole campaign.
You're throwing your blood at children.
No.
That's what it's like.
That's what it's like.
Yeah.
I'm going to be like, Tash, what was it taking?
Yeah.
What do we got?
A placid pond fills the center of open space.
There's a pond.
No.
Flashbacks to when I got hit the first time.
What's the different pond?
Oh, that's the different pond.
Is that a hot in the middle?
Oh, no.
A step the gold arises from a huge boulder that stands in the water.
It's a mimic.
Like an island.
It's a dark bridge crossing the water to the pagoda.
It's red-proof.
It's held up by six sturdy pillars and caps with carved fish.
A human male, very yellow silk robe embroidered with red and gold fish stands in the pagoda.
You hear exotic music being played on a string of instruments.
It's just a hago to it.
Don't know what I know.
Don't know what I know.
Don't know what I know.
Don't know what I know.
Don't know what I know.
Don't know what I know.
Hey, Pagoda.
Thank you.
I know, Pagoda.
I'm just glad you backed me up with that, because that would have been real shimmy.
It would have been done with the inner male.
It would have been a lot less hay.
How could you not?
I waved to the garden.
Say, hey, mate, can we have the gem, please?
Is it Dragon Ball?
No, but he's got a good time.
He's got a good time.
He's got a good time.
He's a bar.
Somebody's got the past.
I'm just going to shoot.
I'll hang this house up every other encounter.
He turns to face you and bows, and then he sits down on the side of the rock.
My bond is a nymph's room.
Was stolen from me?
Can that be way it's from me?
Motherfucker.
Does he have any response to the gem?
He doesn't say anything.
He does speak behind him and gets some...
He doesn't say anything.
He doesn't say anything.
He does speak behind him and gets some...
He doesn't say anything.
He doesn't say anything.
He does speak behind him and gets some cushions out.
Some nice yellow lace cushions in the basement around.
He smiles in your direction.
Oh my god, light of arrows.
All right, let's go get him.
We'll pass it again.
We'll pass it again, exit.
We'll pass it again.
We'll come here, don't we?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Once you go in, you go, you can't go out.
I walk in and I sit down next to him.
Left in, have yet.
Left now, play.
Casey's over there.
Mark!
You're my head- attack.
Keep doing the water.
That'll play.
He encourages you to sit on the cushion.
I've already sat.
I'm now trying to take you to what is...
He wants to play.
He wants to play.
He wants to play, we'll play.
To do it, we're going.
Okay.
I'll go up here on the bit.
This is going to be another fucking light.
There's two top here.
If we can not have to get him into town.
If we can not be sure that he's not in the position.
If he's not in the position.
If he's not in the position.
If we come in and he's just got guitar he'll listen up and he'll be like,
alright, bitches.
I mean it's been a while, but...
